I downloaded it on my iPhone XS, noticing the one star average, but proceeded anyway. After all, I haven’t got time for reviews.  Can I just say, along with all the other one star users, the app is horrible. I thought it was just me, until I remembered the rating. I cannot believe this is an Adobe product. I wouldn’t have used it if the e-book I downloaded didn’t require me to! Unbelievable in today’s day and age that an app so unreliable from a quality brand exists. Shame on Adobe and shame on me for not just buying a hardcopy book instead.",

Yes the software does run on iOS and does respond to user inputs but that is all that can be said. Page numbers in contents pages do not function correctly. You can’t jump to a page by pressing the page numbers which is fine if it’s a 10 year old pdf but unacceptable for content specifically made for the platform. The jump to page feature does not work at all, it’s purely decoration. Content will randomly not display at all depending on the zoom level. Each page seems to require a different degree of zoom to actually display content. This all complements the horrific DRM implementation: if you don’t sign in before downloading something you will permanently lock yourself out of opening that file! All this app is is a glorified pdf reader with  DRM and it fails to do either. A legitimately unusable piece of software. It may be free but you pay with your sanity.",

Seriously I find myself accessing books err... \"Another way\", which I won't go into detail about... And sometimes I will buy the ebook if I know I'm going to read it all (not feasible for uni research though) even though I would otherwise happily use the library's resources.

I finally figured out what the issue was by looking at the comments on the IOS reviews page from several others that had similar issues. The trouble was that you cannot use safari to download it so I had to get an all new internet browser to download it. Then once it was finally downloaded I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of the e-reader itself. The content in the book is great. I know because I have the paperback version. But I was looking for an electronic version that I could take on the road with me and easily access when away from home. When you read the book in the eBook format it looks awful. Words are cut off, you can't even finish reading complete sentences because the formatting is all wonky. This app is absolutely is ridiculous. The quality is so poor it is completely unreadable.",

            "body": "There are problems that me and all of my classmates mentioned while we were using this app. The main problem is that it lags and stops a lot if you are using it offline. When you flip through pages too much, it starts to freeze for a while before you can flip the pages again. So when we were looking for a certain page in our ebook, the app lagged every 10-15 seconds. This happens less frequently with internet connection, but it can still happen. Especially if the app has not loaded certain parts of the book yet.Another problem is that there isn't a simpler way to find a certain page. Even though the app has a scroller that helps you jump through the pages, it doesn't indicate which page you're going to flip to. If there's a way you can do this in the future, that would be good as well.TL;DR I don't recommend this app for anyone who wants to use this for ebooks. Whether for educational or recreational purposes. It's better if you find an app that can do so much better until Adobe fixes these problems. It's not worth it.",

Features like word definitions, phrase translation, underlining and highlighting in various colors, ability to google and hotlink to places, people and art described in ebooks.  I was a big fan and user for many years of Neosoar another DRM e reader.  Unfortunately, they seem to be recently out business.  It took a while for Neosoar to get to a point of near perfection with these features I’ve listed above.  But the absolute best was your annotations were linked to Dropbox.  So, any additions or notations or hotlinks would be saved in Dropbox.  If you changed or upgraded your e reader you would upload the DRM e book and sync with Dropbox and all your annotations would appear.  You would not lose any annotations. Neosoar is a great loss to those of us need an e reader that is fully connected to power of the internet.  It is unfortunate that ADE does not measure up.  In the future it could if Adobe puts in the effort.",

So far the MacOS version is serviceable—not the best navigation but you can get around. The iOS version is unusable. It crashes during searches, pages are missing or unreadable (don’t know if this is a scanning issue, but why then does it work on the macOS version?), and navigation is neglible. Many many people read ePubs on a tablet like the iPad, so it boggles my mind that a company like Adobe wouldn’t put some effort into this product. I imagine with Amazon’s Kindle and Apple’s iBooks taking a lot of the market share, perhaps there is not enough market left to tempt them. But I suspect that there are plenty of authors/publishers who would like to skip the massive fees that both companies impose, so there is a real Power-to-the-Author-People market that can develop here if they play their cards right.",

I also like continuous scrolling for reading instead of having to swipe because it’s a hassle, not to mention if you are reading in a dark/dim space it has to load every page (which takes a bit) and the loading screen is WHITE while I’m reading in dark mode!

A list of things I experience:-Random pages that look fine on desktop look blown out and unreadable on iPad or iPhone. -Authorizing e-books can take multiple attempts and restarted the app before they appear.-Navigation and scrolling through the book is clunky only at a single speed.-Clicking and dragging to highlight text (YES it does actually have a HIGHLIGHT feature!) is clunky: Saved highlights have disappeared and you have to click and drag above a sentence to highlight it as if the entire alignment of words is off.  So if I want to click and drag, I need to do so an inch or less above the actually words to effect them.  -Hidden adware install on the desktop version. If you are not careful it comes with Norton Antivirus which will install with the program if you aren’t careful to hit no on install I could go on. I have asked my textbook manufacture to use another product.  I ask Adobe to make this app, at least functional, but preferably at least competitive to other e-book readers.

Sometimes the resync never happens and I have to do a ritual of settings changes, restarts, and reinstalls to get it back. The app will aggressively delete local copies of things (presumably to save space, but it’s not like ebooks are very large….), including very recently opened files, which has left me more than once with an empty library over a long flight where I was literally reading something on the train to the airport. Really hard to grok how an app could get basic workflows like “I want to continue reading the book I was reading yesterday” so wrong, but somehow this only seems to work like 25% of the time. The desktop is equally broken, though somehow in slightly different ways. Somehow this would be even slightly excusable if the app had any features at all, but tbh it’s a very basic and utilitarian reader app - it’s simple and would be great if it reliably did the three or four things it sets out to do.",

The highlighting feature is almost twice as twitchy and jumpy as before, and I find it even harder to remove highlighting that was done by mistake. Not only that, but instead of being able to tap a drop-down menu for the book's index, you now need to tap the screen three or four times before it registers that you don't want to just be in image mode, and that you'd actually like to access another menu. This menu, which was formerly easy to use and access, has been relegated to a very tiny and hard-to-find button in the bottom corner that doesn't always show up. In addition to that frustration, it's much harder to operate than the last menu. \tMy best description of the new update is that they tried to fix something that wasn't really broken, and in doing so just made it worse.",

I know some authors read their own books for audio books and would love being able to buy a book that also offers the audio so I can follow along when I can and hear the author’s reading it to me.

Next - I Tried to bold fonts to help with my bad eye issues and some portions of the book are in bold, some are not. It’s completely random, sometimes with the bold text stopping in the middle of a paragraph or even middle of a word. Previous books no longer open to my last location, but start at the beginning or random locations in the book, leaving me to flip flip flip flip flip flip back trying to find where I left off. Beyond frustrating. There is a quite long lag when opening a book, often leaving me to wonder if the app has crashed. Not a fan of all the functions relegated to the pop up menu tab instead of being readily available at the top of the screen since I am not happy when I have to have a scavenger hunt just to find basic functions. This was not an “update”. It was a huge step backwards. Someone at Apple really needs to take a course in ui functionality and user friendly interface design.

I have to swipe a previous page or two and then go back to the said page. Lastly: both my iPhone 12 and iPad Air app crashes sometimes. Not too sure why this hasn’t been addressed, but it’s been years since the app came out. The more software continues to advance, it should reduce the problems, not create more. Would like to see my money’s worth purchasing books from this app be put to use on updating the app (REAL updates). It would be much appreciated. But I believe my words are being unheard. Some books I pre-ordered are not showing up. When I hit “View Item” it says that the said book is no longer available in this country or region. Mind the fact, that I waited over a month for the book and now I can’t read it. Not too sure if it’s due to technical issues or incompetent functions. All I know is that this app is getting worse and no one is fixing it.

But then 2022 came along with the release of the latest iOS for iPads. An apple, with its horrible wisdom decided to hand over this project to someone who obviously has never read a paper book. I am furious. As a loyal Apple user for over 25 years, I am seriously open to other providers not just for reading books; but I am ready to go back to paper books, giving up my Apple Watch for real watch, putting down my iPhone, and maybe even considering going with another type of cell phone that is not an apple. With your meals price increases for Apple services, I’ve already canceled those and I’m ready to give up everything that is Apple. Apples become too greedy without any consideration for its very loyal customers changing books it’s just the latest, possibly the straw that breaks many of our backs interest to taking any more from Apple.

The Books app consistently provides me with a seamless and enjoyable reading experience, and I am truly grateful for your hard work! However, one minor issue I've encountered is that when I read books in the epub format, although I've noticed that the Books app allows for customizing fonts, unfortunately, the selection of fonts provided by the app is a bit limited and doesn't include my preferred ones. I attempted to find a solution through Google but was unsuccessful. The response I received was that the Books app doesn't offer additional font options (sad face). I earnestly request if it would be possible for you to add more font options, preferably allowing the import of TrueType Font files or selecting fonts from the system. Of course, it would be fantastic if I could also choose fonts that I have installed in my system (like Pages, Numbers app). Thank you sincerely!

As an avid reader with DOZENS of books it is extremely frustrating to have series separated like this! Now, after this new update, the entire app is no longer user friendly. The font, font sizes, spacing, etc. looks awful. Trying to access specific chapters, settings, bookmarks, and the search bar is super inconvenient. And as small as it seems, having to hit the X in the top right corner to get out of the book is just awful. Due to these changes, I am currently moving all of my favorite books and unfinished series over to the kindle app. It’s depressing to rebuy all of my books on another platform simply bc the developers made all of these changes, clearly without even seeking the opinions of those who use this app. It’s disappointing that Apple continues to destroy so many things that were the reason many of us chose to utilize their products.

I agree with the previous reviewer and won’t re-address those same concerns. However, I will address the book mark and scroll reading  issues.  The slightest touch while scroll reading activates the red book mark which (because I’m reading) needs to be cleared. Sometimes touching the red bookmark is enough to clear it, but other times you have to open the Themes and Settings menu and remove the bookmark there as well. This seems to be more sensitive with iOS 16 than previous versions.  Even more frustrating, though; when using the scroll reading feature near the end of a chapter the (scroll) screen jumps ahead - sometimes paragraphs ahead, sometimes pages ahead, sometimes to the end of the current chapter, or other times to the end of the book. Imagine trying to find where you were reading last when that happens. (An opportunity to use the search feature as long as you have the exact verbiage.)Anyway, to fix the jumping scroll issue I change from scroll to page turning or sometimes I have decreased the font size, and then sometimes I have to close the book because it won’t reload after a font size change. And since the pages are renumbered you can’t just go to your last page and continue reading. Please FIX this bug in the near future. Thank you.",

For a start you can’t do this via the mobile app and have to go through their website. When you do eventually find the section and go through with it, there are no guarantees that you won’t continue to be billed. I cancelled and despite my membership saying it’s not active now as well as a confirmation email I was still charged at the end of the following month. Cancelled 21st Feb, membership officially ended on the 3rd of March I believe and then charged again on the 31st. You go through their first call option which is some sort of online call (after fighting disheartened through more roundabouts of help options) and the call just cancels after a few minutes of waiting, repeatedly. Try the toll free number and well guess what, it says it is not currently active!!! Classic scam warning signs but Audible isn’t a scam. I cancelled cause I don’t have a job now but I’m waiting to see whether some of my food money will disappear at the end of this month if I get charged again. Not happy!!",

In terms of the app, I wish you could purchase through the app. I wish that you could change the timer to view the percentage you were through the book, and that the overall progress timer was visible on books that were loaded in 2 parts. Finally, I wish that there were cost effective subscriptions for multiple books per month as I read maybe 2 audiobooks a week and find that Audible gets expensive so I rotate between this, Libby (which is connected to your library card, meaning that it’s free BUT they will only have a certain amount of copies of a book and you need to wait until a copy is available - like a normal library book - which can be loooong with new or popular books but has a STUNNING app interface that I believe is more intuitive than Audible), and less frequently I’ll listen to Scribd but the selection is average compared to either of the first two I choose and the app isn’t as pleasant as even Audible. Overall, I love Audible because of the range and I would keep it purely based off of that however I also enjoy the interface and the experience of the books. Overall, I",

It was there that I first saw grown men fly through the air to victory. I watched sportsmanship that saw the foulest call by a ref, not even register distain on Richie McCaw’s face because he was already getting in position for the next play. There was a physicality to the game but there more skill than I’d ever seen on field of any other game. This book puts into words the journey we all took while Sir Steve Hansen was at the helm. It will always be topical for the game and whether you played or are a fan, you will find it FASCINATING!!!",

If you are looking for ways to ‘be the change you want to see in the world’ and ‘treat others the way you would like to be treated’ here is an great parenting manual for finding ways to do just that, starting in your home.This audiobook brings together the key elements of NVC, collaborative problem solving, unconditional parenting and social justice parenting in a beautifully presented, easy to understand way.I recommend this book to every parent, it truly has something to offer everyone. If you wish to parent differently to how you were parented, this book will help you tread your own path. If you were parented in a respectful way that aligns with your values this book will provide insight into why it can STILL be hard to let go of 'power over' parenting in times of stress. If you currently parent in an authoritarian way this book provides solid research based reasons to consider the alternatives. Even if you read this book and find it is not for you, it will certainly provide food for thought.I found the content that spoke directly to healing damaging patriarchal, capitalist and racist systems (insidious in W.E.I.R.D. societies) super beneficial. I will refer back to this book whenever I perceive a potential disconnect between my parenting and my values.I can’t wait for a book number 2!",

Rich descriptions of his childhood in Dartford, detailed a seeming no man’s land of post war Britain trying to find its way from the old to the new. Keith’s guiding lights were the Chicago blues artists, who faded in and faded out across the Atlantic airways through the antennae of his transistor radio. Together with the influence of his musical family, and a chance meeting with Mick Jagger (who lived in a posher part of town) a partnership was forged that became the Rolling Stones. Keith rambles at times, yet he rambles with a fierce hearted loyalty and insight into the populace of musicians, women, staff and personalities, who came and went from his life; some of whom who also shaped the face of the sixties and seventies. It’s a gripping tale. I loved hearing Keith speak himself - such a rich, gravelly and warm voice - a welcome relief from the monotony of Depp’s narration and the south London accented overkill of the second narrator.",

Given the large number of books on Audible there are bound to be more customised options available  3) I am often interested in series which are very old like Clive Cusslers Dirk Pitt, Wilbur Smith’s Courtney’s, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan’s. All of these titles cost the same as a new book even though many are decades old and no longer on the best sellers list. I, and many others, would be tempted to buy whole series at a discount or buy one at full price and the rest 50% off, or 2 for a credit.4) Last but not least. I am not one bit interested in LGBT or Australian Aboriginal literature. Many of my favourite books have characters or content which deals with these however it is not front and centre. How Audible pushes books with a pure focus on this content on their clients I find frustrating and reprehensible. Your role is to provide compelling content to all of your clients not force fringe content, relevant to a few, on everyone in an transparent effort to appear progressive and righteous.",

Although I would say sometimes when I’m trying to skip or back it doesn’t let me so that’s one downside but otherwise this app is amazing. Another thing to mention is that if you want to get a monthly ticket or credit to use for a book or podcast you should do it.

This app has changed my life I recommend it to all of my friends regularly and with the subscription you get a new book each month.

The price is more than reasonable, for $15 you get access to a lot of really solid books, plus a credit to use on any book you want, no matter the price. Depending on their age and popularity, some books can be upwards of $30 by themselves, so that’s a pretty sweet deal. Credits carry over and, as long as you keep your membership, they will not expire (if you cancel, be sure to use any left over credits before you do). My only advice is to check the book’s price before you use a credit on it. As I said before, a credit is good for any price book, but that also goes for inexpensive books. They don’t make it easy to see the actual cost, I have to use my phone’s browser because they don’t show you within the app, but there have been books I want that are only $2-3, which would be a total waste of a credit, so I just buy them with my credit card. The only con for me would be (as of December 2022, at least) is the poor compatibility with iOS, you can’t use Siri for any commands other than rewind/play/pause/forward.

Definitely giving the app 5 stars overall! I LOVE my audiobooks. Audible was one of my very top used apps, as I have a hard time focusing on tasks around the house/work/etc without some sort of sensory input. I have it running almost all the time. The last update ruined the whole app for me. I live way out in the middle of nowhere with no wifi and only the most tenuous connection to the data network. Suddenly, after updating the app, it won’t play any of my DOWNLOADED titles without an internet connection. What the heck is the point of taking up my phone storage space downloading all these books, if I now can’t even play them from my phone?? I am so disappointed, as I can’t listen to any of my favorite books at home anymore because I can’t find a place to connect enough to start the chapter. I know I’m just one random human to a huge corporation, but please, please, please, fix this. I am already missing my books acutely. It’s so disappointing to not be able to play my selection of downloaded books.",

A man by the way of John Dawson kept bragging about a store selling  over 800 cars in a small southern town! I thought this has to be bulldodo! But boy was I wrong.    In late January 2018. I set my alarm to get up at 5:30 am to watch a morning podcast! Never had heard one live before. And this man in closet. Was exited that I was watching him. He started telling me good morning, good morning, good morning! I thought the dude was a super human! And over time of getting up early!      My whole world changed.    I was ready to do something different in 2018. Then  I gained our #riseandfamily , hustle and Grind Con in 2018 in October! My income doubled. And the triple after being in the car business since 1981 or 2 cleaning my dad’s service bays and parts department after school and on Saturday. Then running his detail department at Weatherby Auto Sales in 1987. Basically grew up in the business 3rd generation.      But this book by Glenn Lundy The Legacy Titles ! has got me thinking again to venture out on my own. After getting my lifelong dream job as Used Car Manger at Marietta Toyota! Where people had to retire or die before you could get a job there!  Thank you again Mr Glenn Lundy for all you have done for my growth in the car business just a big breath of fresh air! In a very  long time stagnant industry!! Love you Brother!!",

The idea of earning a credit a month to use for any premium item also fine. I had accumulated four credits, when I decided to take a break . Now this is the problem, and in reality it is my fault for not reading the fine print. I THOUGHT that I would take a few months off of the membership to use credits that have been building up. Fully planning on rejoining in a few months time. What I did not realize was that once you suspend the membership you lose all of your accumulated credits .. back to zero. If you seek out this information you will find it. I never looked at the whole contract . Kind of silly to pay monthly and then lose all of you credits if you stop temporarily or otherwise.. Without this issue Audible is a five star company, but this nickel and diming was and is unfair, stated or not , fine print or not. So this is a cautionary tale. If you are a member  or plan on becoming one be advised that if you stop your membership you will lose all of you amassed credits. If you are the type of person that uses the credit immediately, then you are fine. Otherwise heed the warning. You will get your credits erased too.",

It only streams, as I’ve tried twice since the most recent updates. I called and logged the issue with Audible, and told to download in parts. I love the bigger books all in one file. It was fine on my old iPhone 11 Pro Max. I have reflex sympathetic dystrophy, I can no longer hold books or write. So using Audible is so important to me when it comes to the Bible. Use daily and take notes through the app. The app even encourages customers to download all in one file. That’s great, but it doesn’t work anymore for books larger then GB. If anyone like me you have larger libraries, this means can’t even use higher quality downloads on many books. But it’s getting ridiculous the way Audible has gotten lazy. It happens every other year with iOS update and app updates. It either wipes out all of your downloads, or it breaks the app to be able to download. I’ve been at the premium level since 2012, I can’t count the times I’ve bought three extra credits a month. When they had their reading challenges last year, had the amount listened to in a week. I love this app, but I need it to work at the level it has for so many years before. Need this to be addressed and fixed. I can call again and be told sorry, and given extra credits. I don’t want to call anymore if nothing is going to be done to correct the issue.",

            "body": "I’m back to loving the app! My original negative review is below. I got a response from Audible developers who instructed me on how to remove the Alexa button. It was actually very simple, but I couldn’t figure out how before, and had even contacted Audible Help (before I wrote the review) but the rep said Alexa couldn’t be removed. So I’m very happy again with this app. And I’d like the Alexa button if it were in a different location in car mode. Here’s my original review:The new Alexa button is annoying, and frankly, a little dangerous. I used to be able to hit the \"rewind\" and \"bookmark\" buttons in car mode without looking down at my screen while driving. Now I have to look at the screen to hit those buttons because otherwise I accidentally hit that HUGE Alexa button at the bottom of the screen. (Which interrupts my book.) Super frustrating. Sure, I could use the Alexa button instead, but it takes longer to hit the button and say \"rewind 10 seconds\" than just hitting the rewind button like I used to be able to easily do. The Alexa button isn't a bad idea, but why couldn't they have put it somewhere else, and not make it so big? This has ruined the app for me. I sure hope they fix this terrible design in future updates. I’ll gladly change my 2 star rating to a 4 or 5 if they do.",

Jill is a helicopter mom, her life centers around Sophia and everything else, including her husband, is a distant second. Sophia is a spoiled brat. Jill had a rough upbringing and then a traumatic event happens in their lives which leads to Jill being unattached and distant, as well as, having a hard time relating to many people.The second part of the book is where it picks up. Someone takes Sophia. We also get more into another character, Bea, who has a lot to do with, well everything. I won’t divulge because it would reveal too much. We are also given several snippets of a third character, via her journal. That is the part of this book that I really enjoyed.I pretty much knew right away who all the players were before the author came right out with it.  What I didn’t like about this story was all the loose ends left open. There were SO MANY. I feel like the author didn’t give Jill and David their due redemption.I will say this book really was a page turner and I listened to it even when I wasn’t commuting, which is rare.  Aside from the way RD finished this book, it was a good story and the narration was A+. Would I listen to it again…probably not.",

Sorry it took me so long to rate this amazing app! Get it, you won’t regret it, so many wonderful title and books and not over priced!Update: This is still a great app but it needs to be said that the home tab is waaay too much noise visually speaking. Way too many suggestions and advertised books for an app. It’s not a clean look and honestly it’s ugly. The app needs a more sleek minimalist feel for ease of use. I literally get anxiety seeing the homepage with all the extra books recommendations, catalogues and so forth. When I use the app I just want to get to the point not be defaulted to a crazy looking page foot of book images. Please higher someone to update your app comestically. With the IOS update people are discovering less is more with widgets and less apps. Try to use that same concept, I want to see recommendations make it the last tab not the first. Have the first tab be the library and instead of a line chart of books maybe give the option of line display or chart display, just something more sleek please.Update 03 May 2021: The app skips the audio for some reason and when the screen goes dark it stops playing.

While I can divide my attention, this nifty app allows me to focus on both my physical labor and the text/ideas being shared here with the same intensity and similar results. The narrators so far have been great, their tempo, punctuation and emphasis has been on point. The variety of works from which to chose is broad and so far I have found most if not all of the books I wanted to read/listen to. Also, the fact that Audible provides free credits every so often is remarkable( imagine not only how much money is saved but also time to travel and shop for these. Not to mention what if they are difficult to find provided their less then popular demand). The features to control the speed of the narration, also the ability to play on the background for if in the midst of listening one should attend a communication from a friend or family and not want to disturb the suspense built on the best part of the book.   Also, I am sure there are other features I have not explored. So this is it for this review being. Thank you 🙏",

It simply works, and works well. My favorite feature is that it organizes series in their chronologically released order. This means that you can see immediately in your library if you’ve missed one in a long series of books that you enjoy, and can usually immediately purchase it right through the app.Audible, I am retired now, but I look forward to many years of listening pleasure, and it’s all possible because you’ve made such a wonderfully accessible and useful application.

Super clean and easy-to-use interface, simple format to make playlists and discover artists etc, I love it. Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new service. A suggestion I have is to be able to see how many times you have listened to a song. I know on the laptop/pc version this is available, but since I mainly use Apple Music on mobile this would be super convenient. Especially as the music usage doesn’t always sync, making the statistics less accurate for the non mobile devices. Perhaps this could be integrated into the sort function or in the drop down menu that shows up when you press and hold on a song. Either way, I would love to see this feature added.",

When I first started with Tidal, it’s library was modest, but now it is Apple that is lagging, at least with artists that I like. The Apple Music app is not intuitive. It is hard to find music- it’s easier to find music in the ‘Sleep’ genre than Jazz! I gather that their song/artist recommendations are poor too (in Tidal they’re excellent). Your ability to customise your home screen is non existent. For example, why do I have to see ‘kids corner’? For someone who doesn’t have kids (or who wants to but cannot) this is annoying/depressing. The creators of the Apple Music app seem obsessed with playlists. It’s easier find out what other people are listening to (top charts, curated playlists etc) than to find things that I like or might be interested in! It is bizarre!Speaking of bizarre, my library has artists and albums from iTunes days, and newly favourited albums. But newly-favourites artists? Oh no, sorry they’re under the ‘listen now’ section. So despite innovations like the expansion of Lossless and the addition of Spatial Audio, it’s still junk. It’s like selling some of the best ice cream in the world from a recently used abattoir that has a dubious hygiene record. Hope this helps others’ decisions.",

I also did a trial of the Apple TV subscription and Now, I’m concerned about what Apple may do to my Apple TV movies when that subscription expires. I guess I should have just left it alone and not signed up for the trial subscription.

If so, I have attempted to counteract it by clearing all histories. Also, none of the songs are on repeat mode, so this is not the problem. I am not sure what more to do; this is very frustrating, and I have talked to other users who share the same issue. Could there be an option to where every song must play, no matter how many times I shuffle, before being repeated? This may sound dumb because one would assume that I should merely stop pressing the Shuffle button and resume the last song played, but in order to access other Apple Music appliances and play other playlists, this is not plausible. Therefore, there should be a new button: Resume Shuffle!! This in addition to the already Shuffle button (so users can still mix things up), will create a much more enjoyable experience on Apple Music!! I am certain that other users will agree with me.",

This also makes it impossible to find duplicate tracks within your playlists. Second, there is no option to delete multiple songs within a playlist at once - it has to be done song by song, which is absurd. No option to delete multiple albums at once, either. What is Apple’s aversion to letting the user do this? Third, when you are playing a song, there is an option to “go to album” but no option to “go to artist,” which is irritating. Apple Music looks great and sounds great, but it’s not user-friendly in the way it needs to be. Right now, I’m only using it because it comes free in a family plan from a relative.

Please restore these features to their older formats and have a few more trial testers before releasing this sort of failed update.Additionally, when I click the suggest less songs like this, the button should simultaneously function as a skip song button.

Firstly, it's great Apple pays artists more to record this way. It would be a win/win situation except for actually finding the music in the catalog. I surmise that aside from the artists getting paid better, this also gives them store front exposure. For artists with older offerings it rekindles interest in their work. However, with the exception of playlists Apple has put together, many of these recordings remain buried … often with no description of them being done in Spacial Audio or double copies of the same recording. Sometimes you can find a whole Album if you root around but you must continually be persistent especially when only one song by an artist is done this way. The existing Search function is no help either. This is unfair to artists and makes finding content tedious and time consuming. This does not encourage people to adopt this newer way of listening. When one considers the minority of people who many have the equipment to take of advantage of this, it seems counterintuitive to have speed bumps encumbering discovery.",

When out walking it holds a connection for about half an hour and if you skip more than 3 or 4 songs it completely quits loading. I’m in the greater Phoenix area and the cellular signal is great. This model iPhone is less than 2 years old, this shouldn’t be happening. The service is so jenky it’s almost not worth paying for anymore. Sticking to playlists instead of stations helps, but it would better if the app could just operate like it’s supposed to.Also the algorithm has trouble gauging what to play next. It’s like it can’t tell that you’re listening to all up beat, fast music and slow music is skipped, it just keeps pushing slow music. When I get off work I like to go running, at the same time every day I look for upbeat music to put myself in the mindset. It would be great if the algorithm could pick up on that and suggest more accordingly. The pop station is probably my favorite but it takes a lot of skipping and hitting play to keep it going, and at best it’ll only work part of the time. It’s almost easier to just turn on the radio.",

I don’t recommend subscribing to Apple Music if you have a large collection of music and wish to play specific songs - you will have to scroll through 100s of songs yourself to find the one you want to play. 3) Cannot use Apple Music when connected to an external monitor. When connecting via USB-C to an external monitor on an ipad, the only option is to play the music on the external monitor (no option to play the music via the built-in speakers on the iPad itself). This is not a good decision as the developers are forgetting that many monitors do not have speakers. This renders the Apple Music unusable. Quite an oversight considering that the docking functionality of the iPad is targeted at productivity applications.",

There is no like/dislike button so the same content shows up even if you already watched it and content that you have no interest in shows in the recommended list.

If I pay for the service, and tell it what I want to watch, it should *NOT* then force an advertisement for some other show on me.The ads are skippable (this is new since I last had the app a couple years ago), but this is a big hassle on ChromeCast as you’re not sitting there with the app open waiting for the ad so you can skip it.Maybe play ads once someone’s show has ended so they can find something else, but not before playing the show I literally just asked to be played. The whole point of Streaming is to watch what I want when I want to, and I’ll stick to Netflix if this app continues to shove ads where they don’t belong.",

While The Grand Tour and The Tick are easily some of the best shows here, the latter is a HUGE example of missed opportunity through the lack of pushing. Even buying and watching super hero and comedy shows before finding The Tick myself, it never once showed up in suggestions.

And the ads weren’t positioned where the ad breaks are in the show. Middle of a gunfight boom 5 minutes of ads.  After painfully finishing 1883 I started to rethink everything. I canceled Paramount + and have considered canceling prime. Let me be clear. Ads are the worst and there is nothing more triggering. If I wanted to watch ads I can watch any of the free services with ads. If I’m paying nearly 200 dollars a year for a streaming service I’d better not have a hint of an ad.  I will try subscribing to paramount + in the future through Apple TV. But if it has ads as well I might have to leave Paramount behind. The idea of buying shows seems like a much better idea at this point. Not much discovery but my generation hates ads.  Buying digital seems a scam as well even though it’s the most convenient. Scammy is the new game it seems.  If it wasn’t for Sheridan I’d leave paramount on the shelf.",

Maybe this is a change but it’s too much work to look for what I’m already paying for. Also huge con that they don’t offer Peacock but I’m sure if I purchased their channel, it would be the same thing.

Basically after finishing another episode when I press ‘Next Episode’ it goes to the episode that’s locked in the glitch. It eventually auto corrects itself about a week later.Secondly, there’s the ‘Infinite Intro Glitch’. Sometimes when I press ‘Skip Intro’, it loads for a long time and then goes right back to the start. Then every button except the exit one brings it to the start again.The last one is the ‘Forever Loading Glitch’ where after skipping the intro it has the loading icon, but this is more annoying than experience ruining.Please try to fix these or at least have a look into them when you can and thank you to everyone reading this! :D",

However, they will Greenlight a well-received show, and after about 2 seasons they cancel it well before any meaningful conclusion can be made. At the time of writing this inside job had just been cancelled and if it was just inside job I’d understand but they have been doing this to multiple shows where show creators create great shows only for them to be cancelled. The reason why this is a problem is that I find myself watching Netflix less and less as I find there’s no reason to watch a show and get interested when chances are it will be cancelled. And it seems unfair that shows such as big mouth, paradise PD and others get 6 or so seasons whereas other shows only get 2. Both shows are ok in their own right but it is my belief that the resources are being distributed unfairly amongst the shows. Netflix is by no means the only streaming service that does this but they are by far the worse perpetrator. So as it stands one of the only reasons to watch Netflix is for non-Netflix shows as at least non-Netflix shows have some capability of following through with something.",

This time they took away the Downloads tab from the bottom of the screen, for reasons best known to them.  But that was nothing compared to the disaster they created.  All the downloads which I already had but which had expired, I was unable to renew them.  Forever and ever I was presented with the error message \"you have downloads on too many devices…\"  This had never happened before.  Not only that, but I couldn’t download anything.  After many calls to customer service I had to delete all those downloads and start all over again.  That is the kind of outcome customrw are presented with when a company chooses to employ incompetent software designers.  Hours wasted because of app upgrades that are worse than useless.Netflix spends a fortune on programming.  Well, it’s about time they made sure that any app upgrade is absolutely faultless before they present it to its overcharged customers.If I could give this app zero stars I would.  One is too many.

The thing is I never used it whenever I watch Netflix. And by the way, the vpn is only available in my phone and laptop. There’s nothing in the router / smart tv. The thing that really puzzles me is that using my VPN, I was somehow able to access broader catalogue in my region. Of course I brought all of those information to the live chat agent, the response however was stock standard and there was a point where I felt like talking to a bot. The agent was simply shifting the problem to the ISP. At the very least I would expect he/she to tell exactly what my problem or why my account is getting blocked from accessing the broader catalogue. I think a bit more care to the customer is appreciated. I need to think of changing my ISP, if it solves my problem, great, if it’s not then it’s a lose-lose to both ISP and Netflix.",

A lot of good stuff is unavailable in Australian Netflix due to licensing (thanks Australian media monopoly) or just otherwise missing. A lot of older movies and shows are still available on here though which is nice.Content quality wise, if it’s not made by Netflix it’s most likely good. Netflix has gone severely off a cliff the last few years and continues charging more. American social politics is rife in Netflix Originals to the point it becomes the Original’s identity. For things like anime they are injecting American social politics wherever they can when it didn’t exist in the spoken Japanese dialogue in the first place through the subtitles and just outright rewriting a dialogue scene just to fit it in english dub.",

The other problems I am experiencing with the app include slow loading, and lagging with the pause features, rewind and fast forward features. This has made my watching experience unpleasant and I find myself watching shows on Netflix as a last resort when the shows or movies can’t be found anywhere else. I have tried many things in order to solve problem such as, disconnecting and reconnecting my WiFi, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app, none of these Methods have done anything to improve the functionality of the app. Also, this problem isn’t limited to just me, someone else I know happens to own a ROKU TV and is experiencing the exact same problems. I don’t understand selling to a company that is not compatible with your services nor do I have any interest in continuing to give you a monthly fee for inadequate and lagging services.

            "body": "I live in 2 different apartments during the week due to working 2 different jobs. I have the most basic plan because it is mostly just me watching. Occasionally my roommate watches something on my account on the shared tv. I am barely affording to live in this society while working 2 jobs and all I want to do sometimes is sit down and watch something while I eat dinner or before bed. Since they made the new 1 household rule, I continuously have to verify devices and re sign in. I have contacted them and they’re like too bad you have to verify your devices every month in order to use them all. They won’t discount my membership for the inconvenience and they won’t fix it. I finally cancelled my membership due to the emotional distress this has caused me on several occasions. I have pretty severe depression and the lack of accommodation for this disability is quite disappointing. I consistently use the same devices to watch Netflix and yet they still have to be reverified every month. I’ve notified them on multiple occasions of the issue and nothing is done. Sad to cancel but I can no longer handle this extra source of stress in my life. It already costs too much money as it is. Using my very limited energy on re-verifying devices constantly is something I no longer wish to participate in. When you fix this issue I will consider signing up again.",

Action, comedy, horror, romance, family…it’s all there. Personally, my favorite show is Bunk’d, which would be considered comedy. I highly recommend it!!! So amazing. There are so many options.One thing, though. There are some inappropriate shows that show up on even a kids profile. My mom still makes me use a kids profile because of all the inappropriate shows about nudity, drugs, etc and shows with swearing and stuff. It still shows up even on that profile. Just not as much. But could you please have that stuff ONLY on adult profiles? I don’t like seeing it, and I’d rather have a Watch Together profile, and still not see it much. My little siblings—we’re talking toddlers here—see that stuff on their profiles too. I really would like it if you didn’t have all of that.But Netflix is mostly amazing, which is why I gave it five stars, though it was close to four stars because of the inappropriate show stuff. The search bar is so easy to search stuff up, and downloading is nice too (BUT PLEASE MAKE BUNK’D DOWNLOADABLE!!!!!!!). Netflix is cool yo. 😎",

Everything works beautifully and it’s easy to search for what you’re looking for and the list of saved shows is fine too. My big issue, however, is with the currently watching area on the tv app, phone app, and website. Sure there are tons (and I mean TONS) of articles all over the web giving instructions on how to remove shows from the currently watching section that you no longer want to view, but Netflix it’s your job to provide an easier method for doing this. It’s unrealistic to expect people to go into their history and delete a millions episodes of a show just to get to the movies and whatever other shows they need to remove from that section. Just allow a space on the titles to remove them from that area. Especially for shows or movies that you try out and end up not liking. They stay there for months! Also, the app on tv plays the show or movie just when you’re trying to read the info about it and guess what?? That also adds that title to currently watching! Fix this issue please! It’s 2020! We shouldn’t have to google the hundreds of articles teaching people how to get around your archaic ways with this one thing. Do better, Netflix.",

I will say navigation is better on mobile than a computer - on computers when you get suggested titles there’s no easy way to rate what you’ve already watched and yet in both places that presents a problem within itself - if I’ve already watched something I wish you would remove it from the rows of shows and movies and the better way to do this would be to have a previously rated section where all these already rated shows can live. With all the content Netflix has the cluster of what you call organization is a huge turn off and I find myself using the platform less because of it. Also, Netflix basically birthed the term binging so I also hate when you try to be like traditional cable and release shows by date - whoever decided this was a good idea - you don’t understand a competitive advantage when you have one as no one really likes having to tune in weekly if they also had the option of just watching all the way thru (time permitting of course). Again you’ve managed to take a competitive advantage and found a way to regress to be like everyone else. Sometimes people try too hard and overlook the easy reasons why they are losing subscribers and a lot of it has to do with when you lose those core things that made you great.",

There are plenty of times when I’m scrolling through Netflix and I am trying to avoid nudity in shows and movies. Wouldn’t it be great if there were a way to toggle on and off all shows that have a specific tag instead of just the rating? For example, there are plenty of shows that are rated TV-MA and don’t have nudity that are great to watch. However, you have to filter them all yourself and check the rating before hand and it takes up a lot of time when looking for something new to view. Now, imagine if I can just go to me settings page and toggle on and off certain tags to make my browsing easier by removing shows/movies with the tag from appearing during your browsing. Now I know that doing it with every single tag would be a pain in the behind but just doing the major tags would help out a lot of people I think.I also, want to explain what I mean by tag in the case it isn’t clear. I’m not talking about genre such as thriller, action. Etc. I’m talking about the tags associated with the rating system like nudity, extreme violence, adult content, adult language, etc.",

(I do not know if this feature is added) You should also add a feature that locks episodes or movies so your kids cannot watch them. 4. You should sort movies and shows by ratings like PG 13 will go in a row and TV MA there. 5. You should finish some shows. In Netflix most shows are left behind with like 3 seasons but the real show has 8. 6. You should be able to delete movies and shows from the continue list. It is so annoying. 7. Also you may wanna put a lock on PG 13 and TV 14 and TV MA  and rated R and you have to enter a pin and your face so they will know you are not young. 8. You should put a list of shows and movies that you do not like and they won’t be visible to you anymore. 9. You should put a swear word censor on the kids account or Adult account it will be in audio and subtitles. 10. No kids should watch inappropriate stuff and I been seeing on the kids profiles.

I reached out to customer service to see what I could do about using the service in my home I travel to for work, as I am still in the same household as my family but would like to access Netflix. This man’s response to me was “use the mobile app” and when I said I can’t watch on my tv he said “no you have to pay 7.99 for another screen” So I have to pay extra for a service because I travel for work and want my child to be able to watch at home still? This is how you treat customers that have been with you for years? I hear you loud and clear Netflix. Paying for 2 screens is not enough for you, you need more from me. I think you will find this move, and the way you are having your representatives address this with customers (rude and dismissive quite frankly) will be the end of your company. No amount of original content games or reruns will entice people to pay for your app, when there are much better services out there for a lot less money. I actually think I pay in total for 4 other services for what you were going to charge me for your service in both of my locations. I hope you will learn from this mistake, but I don’t think you will. Congrats on being the new blockbuster!",

I understand it helps y’all know what to keep as well as I’m sure it helps the algorithm to suggest shows I may be interested but I actually want to press it less now that it’s in my way. A section geared toward teens would be awesome! Not just young children. Lastly, I would also love an “Expiring Soon” section & also add a little notification as well when clicking on something to watch.

There is still one bug which kind of translates into 2, which is the scaling of UI elements. For people who use larger on screen text for accessibility or have a smaller screen size, the app just breaks. Buttons to accept Steam Guard confirmations don’t fit on the screen and the app can’t be properly used. Landscape mode also works on phones, even though it really should only work on iPads. If you try to tilt your phone sideways on the Steam Guard screen, things get crazy. And the notch blocks things as well.I also wish the video player would be fixed too, you have to tap where you think the unmute button is, and then tap to go fullscreen, but you just get a black window. You then have to close the video and re enter it repeatedly until it works in fullscreen, which is very aggravating. This is on iOS 15 on an iPhone 12.",

I could access everything fine through PC. I could even access family view settings with my family view password. However, I still couldn’t get to the store page because it kept giving me a error for validating the password. I removed and reloaded app and it just became worse. Got it to work once and then black screen of death. Delete/reload again (3times) to same effect. I’m done with this disaster and having to use it for steam guard for the safest version of steam guard is a joke.

At first it wouldn’t let me in at all, then after disabling the app based authenticator and logging out on all devices, I can now get in, but nothing works. Everything I try to do now causes the app to attempt to verify my login, then times out. And every time I close the app, I’m logged out entirely again.  I can still log in on my pc and phone’s browser with zeros issues, so the app is definitely the issue. I’ve tried reinstalling it multiple times, and even logging in with different accounts, and the result is the same — the app is fried.I filed a ticket, so we’ll see what support has to say, but given the lack of support other users are getting with this buggy mess of an app, I’m not hopeful.

When I sign into my account I see all their games and tools. When they sign into their account, that’s being deleted, they see only two games, mine. We can’t stop steam from hijacking my computer doing whatever they want. So technically right now they are deleting my new account, and then they expect me to autoupdate over 100 game servers from the account that signed into my device.

This means i cannot actually search the store within the app. Which, given that this is a storefront first and foremost, is a major problem. With those issues fixed, this is a 5-star app easy. But until then, i can only give it a 3.

You’re still “logged in” using the old password, but since your password has changed nothing works because your credentials are wrong. It also won’t let you log out because the authenticator is active. This problem continues even after you remove the authenticator from your account using a browser.For as much money as steam has you’d think they could afford to pay someone with competence to not have everything fall apart when you try to simply change your password. It’s like the steam webpage, authenticator, and app are all made by separate conpanies in separate countries and nobody speaks the same language or has any way to communicate with each other.

Often times I will be wanting to wishlist or buy games and the icons simply won’t register being clicked and it isn’t very clear that clicking on a title vs clicking on the thumbnail will warrant a different result.

The other is how buggy the store is. If you apply filters and look at a game that interests you, the filters reset. Not to mention you cant see the price of games UNTIL you click on the game, reseting yours filters. Sometimes the page would just randomly reset the filters and you’re back at the start of the page.

The ebooks you download have to be used with \"Adobe Digital Edition,\" which requires you to make an Adobe membership and then \"authorize\" the program with your membership on your computer just to open any of the books you attempt to download. DRM will not allow you to simply download a book and open it like a PDF. However, the real problem is that MY BOOK WOULDN'T OPEN! I downloaded the book and tried to open it with my authorized Digital Editions, and it would simply say \"Errors were encountered in this item.\" I searched online for solutions, and only found that - yup - sometimes it just doesn't work! So I reached out to ebooks.com to ask for a refund, and was told they'd be happy to give me credit or an actual refund, but that they'd first like the specific error I received. By this point I had uninstalled Digital Editions (didn't need a useless program around), so I had to go back and reinstall it. Only now, Digital Editions wouldn't authorize under my adobe account! I told them this, and sent them a screenshot showing this new error, again asking for my refund. They replied back with a link telling me what to do to solve this new, 2nd issue, then insisted my problem was resolved and closed my help ticket. Um, NO! I was able to get Digital Editions to authorize again, but it STILL WON'T OPEN MY BOOK! My original problem - the thing I contacted them about - has been completely ignored. It has now been several days, and several emails later and they are simply ignoring me. Avoid ebooks.com at all costs - do not buy anything from them, as not only is the basic process a nightmare, but if something doesn't work and you insist on a refund, they will just start to ignore you.",

A lot of people seemed to lean to the scam part but what I noticed was that a lot of the complaints seemed to be things that were explicitly stated in the description of the item. For example, a lot of people were surprised because after purchasing their book their realised that they had to install Adobe Digital Editions if they wanted to read on their computer, and they were annoyed by that, which was reflected on their review of the site. The problem is that if you scroll down the description page of your desired Ebook, everything is laid out for you in a very comprehensive way.Seeing that, I decided to purchase the Ebook, and it was delivered right away. With Adobe, it is now on my computer, easily accessible to me for all time. Everything is working well and I'm delighted with my purchase :)",

Like I'm the idiot who can't find the download button.  Nice response.  No, I saw it.  The problem is what happens when you click it?  What? 4 more less-than-intuitive steps? 5?\"Download and install Adobe digital edition (“ADE”) on your computer. You need this free software in order to unlock and read your ebook.

Having said that, you can use their reader - I've had a poke round it and it looks simple and well-designed but I like ereaders and don't have a tablet, so I just download the epubs. They use ADE for DRM, which is the worst software from the worst software company, but there's nothing they can do about that: Adobe have a monopoly on epub sales and it's still preferable to using Amazon.Other than that, it's a decent website with an efficient search facility and I can usually find what I want in one search. For browsing, it's as good as any books website and doesn't try to direct your choices. That tendency to push particular product was what made me look for an alternative to Kobo, and ebooks.com is much better for just drifting through webpages, looking for an interesting title.I'm pretty happy with them. I read paper books as well - I can recommend thehive.co.uk for them - so I don't buy as many ebooks as some people, but I've been spending a lot of  time on the site, planning my next series read after I finish Val McDermid, and it has become a favourite website.All in all, I thoroughly recommend them.",

Not their fault and they gave me a refund right away. Ever since then I have used them pretty much exclusively. I do what ever I can to not shop at Amazon and they always have what I need. For me the key is using  Calibre ebook management software so I don't have to be tied to Adobe's lame reader. This way I can load my books from ebook.com on my Kindle (which... as much as hate to admit it is the still the best reader) without having to invest in Jeff's off world exit strategy. It's one more step but it's really not very difficult. To be honest having multiple propriety ebookstores and readers was really annoying. Now I use eBooks.com and I get the satisfaction reading what I have paid for where I want and not supporting Amazon. I do think they could spruce up their website a little... but it's not that important.",

I cannot since they removed the cd key section so I can't even look up which account is binded, I started a refund just so I could actually get a message across, they ignored the attactched message saying \"I don't actually want a refund I just need help finding my account\" and told me I can't refund it which I was never trying to do.

            "body": "It has been a few years I have actually used my pc for gaming but decided I wanted to have a go again, I purchased a game apparently the way it is done now through an online gaming company (Steam). I read all the specs for the game checked against my system and thought I was covered, except my CPU is the same as it requires it isn't the generation it requires, so after repeated times trying to load this game only to get kicked off each time it got to updating the EULA it just closed and returned back to the steam interface. After many hours of research and finding out what the problem actually was considering i hadn't even got on the game I thought that getting a refund would be easy. Steam however from somewhere has me playing the game for 12.5 hours and told me there would be no refund. So after looking at there support system which is rubbish just a bunch of FAQ's, nobody actually to go through anything with you or a phone number to ring or any real help. It doesn't end there either because there refund team just sends you a mail saying you aren't being refunded after a few hours doesn't even respond to my reply to that the support ticket is just closed. Should it not be down to the complainant to close down the support ticket and not the person the complaint is about ?",

Como usuario que soy de Steam desde hace más de 10 años he visto como se ha ido convirtiendo en una plataforma de juegos de las más tóxicas que existen. La gente comentan en los foros con lenguaje vulgar y despectivo, con insultos y troleando a todos los que no piensan igual que ellos. Lo peor de todo es que los supuestos moderadores de Steam no hacen nada, tan solo se limitan a borrar mensajes que luego los usuarios vuelven a poner con más inquina aún. Steam se ha convertido en un patio de recreo donde cualquiera puede insultar, coaccionar y ser racista sin ningún tipo de sanción. Por ello no lo recomiendo a día de hoy hasta que no cambie su política de tolerancia contra los insultos y malos modales. Hay otras paltaformas de juegos que son menos tóxicas y que ofrecen los mismos servicios e incluso mejores dadas las actuales circustancias en Steam.A really toxic environment. As a Steam user for more than 10 years, I have seen how it has become one of the most toxic gaming platforms that exists. People comment on the forums with vulgar and derogatory language, with insults and trolling everyone who does not think the same as them. The worst of all is that the supposed Steam moderators do nothing, they only limit themselves to deleting messages that users then post again with even more animosity. Steam has become a playground where anyone can insult, coerce, and be racist without any penalty. For this reason, I do not recommend it today until it changes its tolerance policy against insults and bad manners. There are other gaming platforms that are less toxic and that offer the same services and even better given the current circumstances on Steam.",

WE MUST BEAT THEM AT THEIR OWN GAME AND GIVE THEM AS MUCH BAD REVIEWS AND REPUTATION AS POSSIBLE PLEASE HELP SHARE THIS INFORMATION ON HOW UNRELIABLE IT IS TO PLAY STEAM GAMES ON WINDOWS!WARNING TO THE FUTURE OF WINDOWS USERS WHO FIND THIS REVIEW PLEASE SWITCH TO LINUX BECAUSE MICROSOFT IS BECOMING MORE UNRELIABLE WITH THEIR COMMUNIST END OF LIFE POLICY! SORRY FOR ALL CAPS YOUR CONCERNS MATTER REGARDLESS!!!!The digital age gaming needs to be stopped and is effecting the gaming industry dramatically! With Microsoft having a bad reputation of their End of Life policy Steam is dictated into action to FORCE users to UPGRADE to a NEWER version of Windows when people will risk staying on their current version. If Steam wants to lose customers over forcing people to upgrade to newer versions of Windows this shows how mediocre it is to play games on Steam or even waste your hard earned cash on them if I were you guys I would either learn how to use Linux or I would go back to console gaming immediately if Steam doesn't want my money that bad I'm pausing on buying ANYTHING from Steam and wish I could get my money back on half the games I bought from them. Steam in regards of reliability is completely USELESS when you can use a disk console and keep your game for a lifetime and disks are also easily replaceable if damaged and it helps the gaming industry thrive the digital age gaming occult is gonna ruin video games. Either unresistant your communist upgrade policies or I'm done with being a hardcore Steam customer forget it I'm going back to console gaming anyone reading this comment if you want to continue gaming I highly suggest go back to consoles and keep your main computer for basic tasks apparently Valve doesn't want our money that bad enough! If you want to continue supporting Steam I'm not stopping you I would highly suggest get off Windows now and switch to Linux they got a longer End of Life policy than Windows does I highly recommend using Garuda which is open source and appears to have no End of Life policy and is open to any kind of projects. Also I am aware of Steams policy so don't give me that well you're the one who clicked I Agree when it CLAIMS steam is open source that's a lie because if it was open source why can't I still use Windows 7 in 2024?",

            "body": "I am writing regarding Steam's handling of a recent inquiry I made about their promotional strategies, particularly the emphasis on 'Black Gaming of the Month'. My experience with their customer service has raised serious concerns about their transparency and potential racial bias in their advertising choices.I initially contacted Steam to express my concerns over their seemingly exclusive focus on games related to Black history, while seemingly neglecting the contributions and narratives of other racial and cultural groups within the gaming community. This approach appeared to contradict the principles of diversity and inclusivity, which are vital in the gaming industry.However, my attempt to engage with Steam on this matter was met with a lack of substantive response. Instead of addressing my concerns directly, Steam suggested that I use their public forums to discuss this issue, a recommendation that I found inappropriate for an internal policy-related matter. Further efforts to seek clarification and a formal response from Steam were abruptly halted when they closed my support topic, without providing any satisfactory explanation or resolution. A practice they never do under other topic to the support group.This action, and the lack of transparent communication from Steam, has led me to believe that there might be an underlying unwillingness to acknowledge or address potential biases in their promotional strategies. The closure of the support topic, particularly without a proper resolution or acknowledgment of the issue raised, suggests a concerning level of disregard for customer feedback, especially on matters as significant as racial representation and inclusivity.I wanted to highlight Steam's apparent lack of transparency and possible racial bias in their promotional choices. It is crucial for consumers and the wider public to be aware of how companies handle sensitive issues related to racial representation and customer feedback.I hope that Steam reevaluates their communication and promotional strategies, ensuring they align with the values of inclusivity and diversity, and that they maintain a transparent and responsive dialogue with their customer base.",

I had the game on the background and they counted that as play time while I had the Google on. They said I cant get a refund because they show play time of 4 hrs. I told them let me send you 5 min of game time and you can see you cant even play the game for 2 min yet along 4 hrs. I open a dispute with my cc and asked steam for the second time for a refund. I buy many games from them and today apart from resident evil i also bought tomb raider..never had an issue with any games from them until today. Shocking they do not want to refund a paying customer. I will be taking advise on moving to another paying platform. I unistalled and deleted the game and left reviews on steam on the issue, I'm not one to buy a game and request a refund if I dont like it. I want to play the game but it unplayable.

I came up with a way to make the protection more reliable overnight after I was scammed, but they release user security updates, if lucky, maybe once every few years. And even then, they deal with the consequences, not the root cause.As I understand it, they hire people off the street for customer support and pay them pennies because the Steam customer support doesn't give a damn about us.It seems logical that after someone scam your skins, and Steam bans the person who took them from you, they should return the skins to you, right? But no, Steam couldn't care less, even though you were deceived because Steam can't implement basic protection against trade scams.I'm sure it's all because a long time ago, people used to trade skins to another account, then contact customer support, and customer support would return the skins like this: they simply duplicated them, and they stayed with the person who supposedly 'stole them' and with you. But then they stopped doing that, and now they won't give you anything back, and they won't unban you no matter what, they just don't care. They might even ban you for frequently contacting customer support...",

Yet when I make a customer service refund request, I never feel like my problems are answered or reviewed by an actual person. Just automated feeling answers that don't look at your explanations and intent of the return. If you've played more than 2 hours and had the game more than 2 weeks, you're out of luck no matter the reason.Over all, I'd like to know my explanation were read. Maybe this is how it will always be, but in this technology age I think companies should be able to keep up with customers and help come to a solution to keep them happy and wanting to come back for more.In the future I'll have to look somewhere else for my gaming wants and I recommend you do the same.

And then, how one can get their account stolen with Steam Guard protection and two-factor authentication active is honestly beyond me!!! Personally, I have 15 years of service, almost 2000 video games, and 2 Steam Decks, and on those rare occasions when I had problems, customer service was prompt in resolving them, sometimes even at their own expense (for example: recently, they sent me brand new chargers, a case, and a screen cleaning cloth for the Steam Deck, free of charge, which I had mistakenly sent to them with the device for RMA, and which had gotten lost. It was my fault!). The only thing I can say is that, over these years, I have always felt extremely satisfied with the treatment I have received. Thank you for your work!",

Imagine owning a legal car, having a valid license but being allowed to drive only if a cop sits next to you. That is Steam's version of DRM. Does this Gestapo protect  against piracy? No. There are pirated Steam games out there - but my comment is not about piracy, it is about the experience of using a legal copy. The games I play are in \"me vs AI\" format, I am happy with offline mode. But guess what? Even in offline mode it is compulsory to log on to your compulsory account, when the average game developer just gives me a code for my legal installer. ok I try to log on. The system hides my own password from myself, options like see the password when typing or copy-paste are just not available. After 1 day of using Steam I am fed up.",

Because I no longer have voucher codes from many years ago (approximately 2018), or my old bank card details (from 2019), I cannot receive any help from customer support.  Instead, they seem to keep adding in a prompt that I should be the original owner of the account in order to regain access...  I am.  Their customer service options for being locked out of an account are, frankly, laughable.  Looking at the reviews on this page, others seem to have had the same problem.  It is probably also worth noting that the customer service team closed my help request/conversation without consulting me on whether I was happy with the help provided or if I had anything else to discuss.  As I only purchased a license to play the games through Steam, rather than the games themselves, I also have no recourse.  Tldr: Steam have taken hundreds of pounds from me and I can't access my account anymore.",

Valve is the only company who released a system to sell more games like Epic.The proof is thag they give a *** about the basic functions.

I have since removed all payment methods from my Steam account and intend to only use Steam gift cards as an extra layer of security. I would highly suggest at a bare minimum not allowing auto payments from Steam through PayPal or storing bank information on your Steam account.Origin review:I got hacked due to malware. 8 accounts were having multiple access attempts from across the globe (China, Germany, UK, Vietnam, etc). These accounts were Steam, Amazon, Coinbase, Binance, PayPal, Robinhood, Meta, and Gmail. All but Steam blocked access with Two Factor Authentication, Steam's 2FA didn't even register. $200 charged and sent through their Community Market to another user. I started a support ticket and it was closed without response. I then contacted PayPal and they just about immediately issued my charge back. Now Steam has banned me for issuing a charge back and blames me for not stopping the malware. The malware was caught with live protection, but it took about an hour. I lost $200 in about 5 minutes, though it has been returned. With some searching, it seems I am far from the only one to have their Steam Guard (2FA) bypassed and losing items or money.",

I absolutely f#$%$^*( hate that feature and the fact you cannot simply turn it off rubbish. Their 2 week refund policy is absolute dog sh%*t, my brother spent just over $900 on games when I was on vacation and they didn't give a sh*%t, just auto rejected my refund request, I didn't notice this till it was well beyond their joke of a 2 week policy for digital property, that can 100% not endure any form of wear n tear, hell clothing stores that sell physical property have better refund policies than these guys do, it's quite laughable, but greed makes this world spin, or does it??

Games would load but within minutes to half an hour it would quit to desktop and state i have no connection when i do. 12 days ago i contacted their support and attached all neccesary files which they suggest you attach and ive had zero response, i contacted them through paypal and they soon reply saying i cant have a refund becasue ive played their games lol and they went through the hassle of showing me 2 screenshots but they cant spend due time on my case?, they also told me to get in touch with support, which i replied \"i have ive been waiting X amount of days\" still waiting for a reply on paypal. Customer service is appalling one star rating on trust pilot just like their games, why does ANNO 1800 have to be published by ubisoft :(, £100 on steam doesnt make a difference becasue it still uses their broken, buggy, game breaking launcher, never again. I'm staying away from anything this crippling company makes no wonder they've axed how many games and are falling apart.Good luck Avatar your going to need it.

            "body": "I bought the Collectors Edition for Frontiers of Pandora from Game which is Ubisoft's UK supplier. I was absolutely gutted when it arrived yesterday and was partially damaged. As part of the edition there is a coffee table style art book that has 2 pages glued together about halfway in. They are so welded down that there is no way of prising the pages apart without causing further damage. The book is not available for purchase anywhere else so it isnt like I can just buy the book elsewhere and enjoy the rest of it. In terms of collectability value, the damage therefore renders the Collectors Edition that I paid £200 for utterly worthless. As Ubisoft designed and developed the Collectors Edition we got in touch with them, not only explaining the problem but also providing pictures and proof of purchase. Our hope was that they might be able to send us a replacement book as we know that other game companies have done this for their gamers in similar circumstances. Unfortunately, Ubisoft is a company that doesn't give a damn about its gamers. They told us that we need to take it up with Game. This was damaged when it was made guys, have you not heard of quality control?! That was last night and  we are still waiting for an acknowledgment from Game. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. I ordered this 6 months ago and have looked forward to it for 6 months. It was a lot of money and like I might as well have set fire to my £200. I'm very angry and will not be buying anything else from Ubisoft, be it games, collectors editions or any other merchandise. If I don't get a resolution from Game, I'll be reporting both companies to trading standards. I never let a company rip me off more than once.",

This has been going on ALL WEEKEND to the point where I was just done I am mentally exhausted just answering the same questions and providing the same response to literally 10 different people but y'all can't have a call center because that would be just too problematic right lol they shut down basically every possible way to get in touch with them besides Twitter.

Please forgive me for the confusion. It appears that I would not be able to close the case for now. It seems that the team is still processing one of your refunds. We will get back to you once we have more information. Thank you for your patience.------------------------------------------------------------All good, i got a second answer :My name is Ubi-Devin , as I see the issue has been forwarded to our concern team and it's still under investigation. Once the investigation is completed, we will get back to you.-------------------------------------------------------------Every time they answer they close the support ticket, so after 5 days of the last answer i got back to them asking for any updates .Well the only answer i get now from different people its an automatic answer saying the same thing all the time.This is the answer i get over and over:I hope this email finds you in good health. Please do not worry, I'll do my best in order to help you with this and provide all the necessary information. It is to inform you that it has been been already refunded to you, I would request you to please check your bank statement.-------------------------------------------------------------Whats the point of those automatic answers when they have allready escalated this to the concerned Team ?They dont read anything, they dont even check if the support ticket have been escalated, they dont even ask to the appropiate people about an update of the issue, what its their job for most of the people that answer the support tickets ?Press 1 = Automatic answer: Nothing to do with the issue.Press 2 = Automatic answer: Keep close the support ticket with no answer at all.Press 3 = Automatic answer: We ask that you refrain from responding.Press 4 = Automatic answer: Once the investigation is completed, we will get back to you.The number 4 its the one i like the most, they close the support ticket and than not answer for weeks or months, than when they get back to you, they press 1 , 2 and 3 a few times and than they need to re-escalate again and the case back to the queue again from the beggining.I have been waiting 6 to 8 months, on january 31 they forwarded the issue to the concern team and it's still under investigation, now almost a month and they keep closing the ticket .",

I downloaded a gaming demo off of Steam the other day and boy am I glad that I didn't pay a cent for it because I couldn't even access the damn demo because of the terrible way that everything was set up. Before I can even play the game, I have to make a uplay account, which is fine, except for the fact that every time I tried to make the account, I was given an error message that account creations are unavailable at this time. I decided to wait about a day to see if there were any improvements on this front--there weren't, it was the exact same error message. I then decided to look online to see if anybody had any way to fix this; apparently, in order for me to make the account I had to go to the website istelf. Why even offer a service on the application if it doesn't work at all and you have to go somewhere else to get it done?Whatever, I thought this was the end of my troubles; it wasn't. No of course not, that would be too easy and would require for this company to actually try to make something functional. Because of course, now the issue is that it's having trouble connecting, despite the fact that my internet connection is just fine. I reload and try the same thing only for the same problem to arise, so at this point I just decide to try and play offline. Guess again, apparently I need to log in at least once to be able to play offline and apparently in order for me to able to log in at least once, I need to play online, which I can't do. Wonderful. So once again, I have to rely on the internet to tell me what to do, and none of the suggestions worked. I checked my internet settings, I turned off my ad blocker, I checked proxy settings to make sure nothing was blocking the game's connection, I relaunched the game, I reset my computer, etc. Nothing worked. I saw someone say that they needed to download a vpn in order to be able to fix their issue. That's ridiculous. Why should I need to download a vpn in order to fix a problem that shouldn't be a problem to begin with? This is where I gave up and uninistalled the demo.Steam says that I played the demo for 15 minutes and not a single one of those 15 minutes were spent on the actual game itself.This is an absolute embarrasment on the company and it is astounding how they let problems like these remain.",

            "body": "I have been a Ubisoft Customer for many years, since the original Rayman on the PS1 and then Assassin's Creed on the Xbox 360. I am a massive fan of the Trials games and have bought them all over the years. However after dealing with Ubisoft Connect, I will now go out of my way to avoid buying anything from Ubisoft ever again. Ubisoft connect is complete garbage and it makes playing Ubisoft games orders of magnitude more difficult to deal with. From the app not connecting, or crashing, or wanting to always be online, or asking for the password over and over and over, to signing me out not more than 15 minutes since I last signed in (and ticked \"remember me\"), I've just had enough. Curse you Ubisoft and all of your greedy/incompetent executives making the decisions at the top. Alongside the microtransactions that are basically turning Ubisoft into EA Games, the latest Trials game and Riders Republic are both massive hot messes and clearly hasn't been planned properly or tested from a UI point of view, and that's even if I can play them due to Ubi connect garbage getting in the way. Games don't need a launcher nowadays, and Ubisoft's insistence to integrate everything more and more heavily in the terrible launchers has driven away a customer entirely. Well done Ubisoft, you probably wasted a great deal of money and teams of people to create Connect, and all it's done has ensured that a long time customer has grown to hate your organisation and I will be doing my absolute best to avoid playing anything you make in the future. The fact that I'm so angry with your company that I have to write a review here, simply makes me even more angry.I hope you're happy, because I sure as hell am not, and I'm going to vote with my wallet. By the looks of the other reviews on here, I am not alone in my opinions. Well done, your corpoate leadership are cretins who are out of touch with their customers. Sack them all and replace them with an old mouldy potato hooked up to a random decision generator. It wouldn't make things any worse the way I see it.",

It's very disappointing when you try to log in and you mistype your password twice and have to wait thirty minutes to retry. It's stupid of a company so big that they purposefully ignore bugs or glitches for weeks at a time. For example Siege, Clash was disabled for three weeks at one point because they didn't want to fix her glitch: Ubisoft consistently said \"Under Maintenance\" even though nothing was done. Another example is the website, the support is almost always useless, one link leading to another; let's not forget the horrendous wait for a live chat. You've ruined games, you can't develop good games and shut down newer and progressive games you work on. You hire devs that don't do their job. You still have a contract will battle-eye and yet it fails to do its job. You have failed the community Ubisoft, you expect players to continue to buy but eventually, you will lose them all.",

Customer services' \"solutions\" are to sit and wait for an issue to resolve itself which is understandable the first time but not acceptable the second time after you waited their requested time. So my \"non-refundable\" money is sitting on their garbage site because I wanted the $10 deal they are having.

That makes sense, right? Just like on Steam, you can purchase a game for yourself or gift OR if you own the game already, you are given a warning that you already own this game, and it can therefore only be gift!In 2020 I purchased a game on Ubisoft as a gift for my brother. Keep in mind I already owned the game and had more than 500 hours play time in the game. I didn't know that you can't gift games on Ubisoft...Anyway of course Ubisoft is a scamming company, so they let you purchase as many copies of the same game you own as possible. After purchasing the game, I realised that I couldn't gift the game even though I now owned 2 copies. I contacted Ubisoft and they refused a refund because I already had 500 hours in the game even though I’d only purchased it 2 hours ago...I had to contact PayPal to get my money back.Ubisoft then banned me from buying anything in the store, but never actually told me about the ban. When I had trouble buying anything else in their store, they said it was \"maintenance\" and when I questioned them how it was possible that a friend could buy something but not me, they just said that it was an error and try later. Fast forward 8 months and I was still banned and unable to buy anything in their store!On 1st October 2021 I pre-purchased a game which was released at the end of January 2022. Mid October 2021 I found the same game elsewhere but for £10 cheaper, so I decided to cancel my pre-order and get a refund to buy it elsewhere. But Ubisoft can’t make it as simple as you just click to cancel a pre-order, no no.You have to create a ticket and contact customer services!On 10th of October 2021, I created a ticket to cancel the pre-order and to ask for a refund. But by beginning of January 2022, I’d still had 0 response about cancelling my pre-order. I then had to contact PayPal yet again to get my money back. The game was released at the end of January 2022.Then on 10th of February 2022 I got a response to my ticket saying that I’d already got my refund through PayPal.No mention about being banned or getting banned.Fast forward to End of October 2022.I tried to make a purchase few days ago and purchase failed and i have received email that my account is flagged as fraudulent.Here is what email says:\"A recent transaction associated with your account was flagged by our security system as being potentially fraudulent, and as a result, this transaction has blocked. Please note that you have not been charged for this transaction. We will continue to monitor activity on your account as part of our ongoing efforts to protect accounts from fraud.\" Once again contacting ubisoft...Giving me excuse there is maintenance and when i said my friend was able to make purchase and I got this, they said it happens wait 48 hours and try again...What a scam company this is!!Refuses to refund you, but when you get money back through paypal they ban you for their mistake and then they treat you like sh**talking down to you like you are 5 year old, patronizing and absolutely giving 0 sh**s about you!!The worst company out there!I would rather talk to PC technician in call centre in India than dealing with ubisoft scammers!!",

            "body": "Where do I even get started lmfao... Okay.. Well best thing I can say as a reviewer is.. 'NEVER PURCHASE FROM THE COMPANY' seriously though NEVER!.. I'm a huge Rainbow Six Siege fan/player.. I've spent over a thousand in total on merch and DLC and everything with over 4000 hours on my account and like level 200+!! (since wind bastion so imagine how much I played considering king george is a few thousand higher than me on hours played but he's been playing since day 1, I play more than him per year!)I've always played legit and I am a YouTuber + Streamer so you can clearly (obviously) imagine I would play legit due to being watched 24/7... well I got banned by their Anti-Cheat Battleye permanently for cheating?? I've streamed 9/10 games I've ever done of the game and for the games I haven't recorded.. My r6 stats say I'm some silver trash noob... if I was a cheater would I be in silver with a negative KD?? :')Lmfao... but the point of this anyway is I bought every elite skin in the game, plus merch i.e tshirts and pro team jerseys which were a bomb in itself, plus other DLC i.e event packs and rick and morty bundle or pro league bundles.., essentially £1000+ as my friend did the math, you do it if you don't trust as I CBA.. and I bought every event alpha packs so I wouldn't miss out too.. so altogether, everything was soooooo much spent (up to like mute protocol or reworked outbreak event before ban etc..) and to lose it within a click of a fracking finger.. as if I mean nothing as a loyal trustworthy legit customer... Now I'm not gonna lie I'm a wildcard player.. some games I play trash (like some copper 5 lmfao).. some games I play god like (idk, like a plat with brain cells of a diamond or champ but lacking aim hence plat as the example), I'm one of those unpredictable players who can either impress or disappoint .. but I've seen the chat a few times saying I'm reported for getting a 2k? How pathetic is that? I couldn't care less about the report, do it for all I care.. I'm legit!! (little did I know I'd get banned due to Witcher cheats!) Like in my eyes anything under a 4k is lame but sure.. report me and that for getting a 2k.. but the problem is, I heard battleye scans your full PC if they are \"suspicious\" and perhaps that might be where my ban fit in.. I have no r6 cheats.. but I am trying my best to get into the Witcher 1 with the hype of the show and friends etc... and I couldn't win that fight against the first boss (fire wolf creature thing where town is hypnotised as bad people) so I downloaded witcher god mode client etc... and I only use that mod if I die more than like 10 times to save time as I wanna get to witcher 3 and be able to converse with my friends etc.. but I feel Battleye has scanned my PC and picked this crap up and gone \"CHEAT\" when yet nearly 90% of my games have been streamed live on twitch and the remaining have been hard drive recorded or just been boring matches.. either way..I got banned permanently and you have the last 10-12 matches on replay and I viewed every single one.. not one of them were I cheating so why am I permo banned?? and they want me to buy more elite skins.. hahahahaha NO.So to summarise it all.. I supplied evidence and sent it to battleye.. did they respond?? NO.. Like imagine that... the company that falsely banned me after I spend £1000s on their game decides oh no he's deffo cheating permo ban him and never respond.. like wtaf?? I sent them evidence of my streams and matches and you wanna know what they did??? They IGNORED ME?!? Appeal a waste.. No F's given, all my hard worked money wasted.. no chance I'll see that again or get any chance.. not to mention too I'm poor af so Ubi got more than they deserved off my bank... There's me thinking switching from Xbox to PC would be safe.. little did I know you get banned with the littlest of things... What do you want Ubisoft and Battleye? You want me to stop learning computing & IT level 3 at college, delete every software I have? College teaches me database and mobile app macros bla bla.. UBI BAN ON SIEGE... screw you... I provided evidence and you didn't even respond.. you probs laughed about it in your coffee break like every other poor soul you ban whose innocent to this crap.. Learn to ban! not BAN BAN BAN willy nillyseems like in order to play the game you have to factory reset if every time.. so there's no software overlays that'll ban you.. OH don't forget too... never do computing & IT in college either because the software you're learning will be an insta ban too.. UBI wants fresh PC's and they disregard any fracking video evidence you show them.. you could literally show them every game you've ever done on streams and they'll still blank you and refuse an unban... still wanna play R6 PC? if you do.. best of luck honestly.. I give you a year before some random ban.. where's you're proof? oh it's there! nevermind I CBA LOLOLOL",

What’s even worse is the player base has become so toxic in these games due to the ability to spam or use exploits. It’s unfortunate that games like ufc 5 get these great reviews from these major companies stating that it’s a good game, but the only reason must be because they are paid to say it because once you get into review places like this, you see the truth.

This is my story;it started off with me wanting to play Star wars battlefront 2 with my brother, i installed it on my Playstation, ofcourse i saw that it was connected with an old EA account i have no access to, the email has been long closed down since it was associated with a provider, so i contacted them, they give you the most brutal questions in order to get access so you can manually unlink, which in 2023 is just bizarre. But they ask you your IP address (like the one you used when you made that account) and several other bull questions, while they know and see that the account has no phone number or credit card associated to it. i've opened a ticket 3 times and every time they give the same unsympathetic get-out-of-my-way reply that says to try again and try to remember more info to gain access to the account, which again i wasn't trying to i wanted to unlink that account from my Playstation, which again in 2023 shouldn't be this stupid, why i cant unlink it through playstation? only god knows. So now i am stuck with a ton of EA games i can NEVER play on my playstation because someone from EA made the most bull questionaire to get your account unlinked, oh no wait!, regain access to my account -_- , which i don't even want, i merely want to unlink, and in order to do that i need to regain access to the account, which once again is Incredibly dumb in 2023. The customer support was incredibly uninvested and did no effort to help me out. As for why they cant unlink it manually is bull cuz i know plenty of other services where i had an old account linked where they WERE able to unlink. Seriously if you have the option to choose a service over EA, 100000% do this since EA is just a money grabbing, ballbusting-Party pooper. Not to mention had 2 customer support agent's with incredibly difficult to understand english, where you come from doesn't matter, but your english proficiency most definitely does when your an international support agent. Had to explain my problem 3 times before they actually understood which was NOT helping either. the day they announce \"PSN now allows you to unlink from EA with your playstation account!\" is when i get so wasted i wake up in my car.",

Keeping the Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game operating without updates already requires minimal effort, so why does Electronic Arts have to deprive their loyal customers of their money and enjoyment by brutally removing Kim Kardashian: Hollywood from the Apple app store and making the Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game inaccessible from April 8th, 2024? This is ridiculous and extremely intolerable, Electronic Arts. All Kim Kardashian: Hollywood players have lost faith in Electronic Arts and fear spending money on mobile games by Electronic Arts as they are insecure about whether the Electronic Arts mobile games will close down later, resulting in a massive loss of real-world currencies. As an advanced Kim Kardashian: Hollywood player who expended a large amount of real-world currencies on Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, I am very disappointed in the decision reached by Electronic Arts to close down Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Please overturn the decision to close down Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Electronic Arts by either allowing other mobile gaming companies to acquire Kim Kardashian: Hollywood or rebranding Kim Kardashian: Hollywood without Kim Kardashian as the celebrity if Kim Kardashian’s contract with Electronic Arts on the mobile game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood has expired, for example using the mobile game title ‘Hollywood Life’ and removing the game character Kim Kardashian from the storylines after the game character Kim Kardashian rings a phone call announcing her break to focus on other priorities, and allow our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood avatar or doll to be the main character.

I havent logged into my account for a while with stuff that I have bought from them for over 1000 Euros. I tried to log into my account but my login had expired so I contacted customer service. He told me that he could not restore my account and the only way for me to do so would be to update my password. I no longer have access to the e-mail address I used to create the account but they can not do anything.So I spoke with the university of Iceland that are forwarding mail from my old e-mail to my new one so I tried updating my password 5 times last night. Nothing, nada.So I contacted them again, now they are telling me my account has been deleted by me and there is nothing they can do.13 tickets have been opened about this case. 13 people have chatted with me. No body can help me. The people that are working in their customer department are all from India, speak very little english and go obviously by transcript.So in order to open my account I need to open new account and purchase the same stuff again because the i and morons that are working in this company are  that dont know what they are doing.There is no way in hell I will be purchasing again what I already have in an account I did not delete but the system did that was designed by moron!

            "body": "I am starting to think that EA are just scammers really.I bought FC 24, maybe 90$ or so. It is my mistake, considering all the issues I had with their anticheat for Fifa 23, but how stupid was I to think they would've solved the issue for Fifa 24. Not only they haven't, but the problem is even worse.I did manage to play 8 hrs of FC24 while using the troubleshooting I was using for FIFA23 but then it stopped working.So I tried all the solutions I could find on Google and one the website, I spent 10 hours trying to solve the error of EA anticheat (hence more than my time spend playing^^).Having more than enough to try endless procedures I tried to contact EA to get a refund, as they basically sold me a game that is not playable. I managed to start an online chat with them. The agent categorically refused to refund me the game because 'he didn't have the refund button'. I asked him to redirect me to someone who does have that button. Instead of what he gave me another pointless troubleshoot procedure and as I had to restart the PC I had to leave the chat. He conlcuded saying that he was sure that the solution would work. It obviously didn't.And what was my surprise when I tried to contact them again. The option to chat online or send them an email was not available anymore...I tried to post a message (a little bit bitter to be honest) on EA forum to ask for a refund. An EA community manager sent me a link to an EA page basically telling me that I was legally not allowed a refund.I feel like even this is untrue. Because I cannot play their game anymore, even if at first I did manage to launch it ; and the fact that it is unplayable is because of their bad software ; they are just not respecting the very basic standard of selling a game that is playable.My request for a refund is more than reasonable, I spent 90$ for a game that just sleeps on my computer without me being able to play it.Even the hours I spent trying to solve the issue are not normal.I take the time to write this review and I will try to put it on as many websites as possible in the hope that maybe people do not make the same mistake as me, giving their money for a dishonest and unprofessional company not even capable of delivering functional softwares.",

I told them i bought the code as a ea c app code and had nothing to do with steam.  they proply apologised and then told me id wait and get email from a special team.

They are churning out one expansion pack after another and not focusing at all on the quality of the content being released. Judging by a few youtube videos, it's obvious that at this point a gamer might be glad that something works at all. Not to mention that if a player wanted to buy all the DLC, they would pay over $1000. Overall, it seems to me that the whole The Sims franchise went to the toilet after Will Wright left. I don't know what exactly is the reason for the low quality, but something needs to change soon or all their paying customers will soon leave.

I feel ripped off and scammed. They do resets on games like fifa where you can't import your cards over unlike previous gens. Because It's a new title because they lost their rights with fifa. More like they did the reset knowing profits would soar and they could once again exploit a player base. Everyone loses their teams, but that's fine. You can just spend again for the same cards you already own last gen. The promo card packs they offer, have low pack weight and bad odds and grinding challenges for free packs becomes demoralising when you finish 25 squad battles only to end up with an 84 rating card as well as some other trash which you can't complete an SBc you want with.

            "body": "The game I play is Covet Fashion. It has the worst customer service or compensation for their glitches that I have ever experienced in any company or game I’ve played. The most recent one is related to an event. Covet has many goals and events (like the rally) where if you hit the goals, you receive rewards. Covet had a glitch (one they admitted to) that miscalculated goals for the rally, and therefore didn't give me or my team our deserved rewards. They have continually refused to give us our earned rewards despite me messaging Customer Support three times explaining the issues, sending screenshots of undeniable PROOF that we hit the goal for the rally, but they do not read and send a copy/paste while refusing to give the rewards we earned. We should’ve earned 35 pieces plus bonus pieces and they only “compensated” us for 8. This was a glitch on their end that will result in us not receiving a closet item worth over $30,000 because of their refusal to give us what we earned. All I am asking is for the deserved rally pieces  that my team do rightfully earned so that we can get our $30k closet piece we earned. I have put over $200 of real money into this game for them to not compensate us with the rewards we earned. I don't know why this is so hard for them to resolve. I have numerous screenshots proving this fraud, please let me know how to upload here.",

It's incredibly annoying that racists get to continuisly harass non-white people on the Gallery, get reported, but doesn't get banned, and EA decides to ban the person who REPORTED the RACIST for, you know, BEING A DARN RACIST! I also NEVER curse when I was able to use the Gallery, not directly at least, and it's not even obvious it's cursing unless I translate what the filler words for cursing mean. It's so unfair that EA is so... racist! They actually SUPPORT RACISTS BY BANNING THE PEOPLE REPORTING THE RACISTS FOR BEING RACIST! EA, if you don't unban me within the next 48 hours, I promise I'll NEVER play your stupid games EVER again! EVER! I'll take backup of that stupid sims game released 10 years ago on an external hard disk, and then delete the game from my PC because it's wasting space. I promise I'll always give you 1 star on every reviewing platform I can find. You're a multi-million dollar company, yet insist that racist people who call non-white people varioous SLURS deserve to continue to harass PoC, but ban the PoC who report these racists? You've lost your shine.I should probably add that the reason for the ban is Harassment, but as I've said, EA have lost their shine a long time ago, and doesn't bother to provide any specific information about the harassment, the exact date when the supposed harassment took place etc.",

            "body": "EA Sports FC 24 - The best and the worst game you can play.The Best - because the Ultimate Team game is addictive and fun to develop your team throughout the year.The Worst - The game has more bugs in it than a 100 year old mattress. In particular the menu system which freezes up or puts weird boxes and shapes over the screen more times than I can remember now.The Worst - Because the game is fixed and is only sometimes a game of skill. Unfortunately, EA cannot help but get involved in games where they should basically just leave it to one persons team and his skills against another persons team and their skills. The deciding factor on who should win the game being who has the best combination of a good team and good skills. BUT, unfortunately, it isn’t this way, because in most games EA have programmed the game to help out one of the players in certain situations. The fixing of these games where no matter what you do you cannot score just ruins the game completely.Overall this was my last year playing it and for the first time ever I have removed it from my games console and my phone only a few months into the game. I’m now going back to playing Call Of Duty and thank god that EA doesn’t produce that game because if they did I could just imagine shooting a bullet and watching it swerve off course in the final metre before it hits the target to give your opponent a chance in the game.Seriously EA, I don’t know why you fix the games and help opponents out, but it makes a complete joke out of the game because if you lose you don’t know if your opponent was helped out in some way and if you win you don’t know if you were just good or maybe you were helped out in some way and it was your opponents turn to lose.The laughable part of Ultimate Team is that the better you make your team, the better EA makes the opponents team, in single player and in online play too. I always thought the idea was to make your team better to make the games easier in online play, or, in single player a better team should mean that you could increase the difficulty setting, but no, instead EA increase the hardness of the team you are playing against making it completely pointless to develop your team.Complete waste of time game that just has you going around in circles for a whole year until it starts all over again.",

They ignore reasoning and just couldn't wait for an excuse to wipe out coins earned over a 4 month period.Even when i admitted the mistake (on behalf of my son) it makes no difference. I will be looking legal action or a small court claim. They refuse to give me any details on how to complain or write an official letter. How can that be legal or ethical. Anyone that can help further I'd be happy to hear from them.Thanks EA for ruining the fun i once shared with my son as he now refuses to play the game. He's devastated! I will ensure that we never buy any games from EA again and will advise all friends, family and colleagues to do the same. You have lost a loyal customer and you are a complete disgrace.

The only way I am able to access me EA account is by logging in with my Xbox credentials where I could see that my information was not up to date like my email addres, password, DoB, etc. A 3 hour process of navigating a non-user friendly website and chatting with 2 associates of EA for a simple email and password reset only to be asked multiple questions, not to be leveled with, not to be given a solution, and the chat being cut off on me before there was any resolution both times when my internet connection is phenomenal, is absurd. Kartig-Singh and UJJWAL I believe there names were and they were a total loss for helping my situation. My EA account will remain in limbo inaccessible to me fully for forever, if I want to link my EA account again, I can't,  and even if I unlink my Xbox to that EA account and create another, I'll lose all my progress....EA is a joke and worried about their pockets more than the people they should be supporting as we support them as a creating platform.

Every message I sent seemed to disappear into a black hole, only to be met with delayed and inadequate responses.I don't know if Parth was simply overwhelmed or if they just didn't care, but their lackadaisical approach wasted nearly 2 hours of my day and kept me hanging for ages.

I asked for a refund within that time frame and the agent refused because “there was a bug and it’s getting fixed” it was never fixed of course and now they still refuse to refund because it’s been passed the 24hrs even though I reached out in proper timing. Hopefully sims 4 gets away from them and creates there own customer service because dealing with these people has been nothing but hell. Apparently they can’t escalate anything to supervisors or managers, they have “no such option”",
