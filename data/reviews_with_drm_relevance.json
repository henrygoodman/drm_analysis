I have the creative cloud since I’m a design student and use a multitude of adobe apps with ease. Nothing has caused me more frustration than this app. If you have an iPad don’t bother with this. I am now having to view my book chapter by chapter while studying for an exam because at least this way I can view it on pdf viewer. The introduction book on this app doesn’t load properly, half the pages are faded, pixilated and hard to read. I have deleted and downloaded this app multiple times and the issues stayed the same. Don’t bother with this app, save yourself the headache and look for alternative solutions.",

Yes the software does run on iOS and does respond to user inputs but that is all that can be said. Page numbers in contents pages do not function correctly. You can’t jump to a page by pressing the page numbers which is fine if it’s a 10 year old pdf but unacceptable for content specifically made for the platform. The jump to page feature does not work at all, it’s purely decoration. Content will randomly not display at all depending on the zoom level. Each page seems to require a different degree of zoom to actually display content. This all complements the horrific DRM implementation: if you don’t sign in before downloading something you will permanently lock yourself out of opening that file! All this app is is a glorified pdf reader with  DRM and it fails to do either. A legitimately unusable piece of software. It may be free but you pay with your sanity.",

Many many people read ePubs on a tablet like the iPad, so it boggles my mind that a company like Adobe wouldn’t put some effort into this product. I imagine with Amazon’s Kindle and Apple’s iBooks taking a lot of the market share, perhaps there is not enough market left to tempt them. But I suspect that there are plenty of authors/publishers who would like to skip the massive fees that both companies impose, so there is a real Power-to-the-Author-People market that can develop here if they play their cards right.",

So if I want to click and drag, I need to do so an inch or less above the actually words to effect them.  -Hidden adware install on the desktop version. If you are not careful it comes with Norton Antivirus which will install with the program if you aren’t careful to hit no on install I could go on.

I finally figured out what the issue was by looking at the comments on the IOS reviews page from several others that had similar issues. The trouble was that you cannot use safari to download it so I had to get an all new internet browser to download it. Then once it was finally downloaded I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of the e-reader itself. The content in the book is great. I know because I have the paperback version. But I was looking for an electronic version that I could take on the road with me and easily access when away from home. When you read the book in the eBook format it looks awful. Words are cut off, you can't even finish reading complete sentences because the formatting is all wonky. This app is absolutely is ridiculous. The quality is so poor it is completely unreadable.",

            "body": "There are problems that me and all of my classmates mentioned while we were using this app. The main problem is that it lags and stops a lot if you are using it offline. When you flip through pages too much, it starts to freeze for a while before you can flip the pages again. So when we were looking for a certain page in our ebook, the app lagged every 10-15 seconds. This happens less frequently with internet connection, but it can still happen. Especially if the app has not loaded certain parts of the book yet.Another problem is that there isn't a simpler way to find a certain page. Even though the app has a scroller that helps you jump through the pages, it doesn't indicate which page you're going to flip to. If there's a way you can do this in the future, that would be good as well.TL;DR I don't recommend this app for anyone who wants to use this for ebooks. Whether for educational or recreational purposes. It's better if you find an app that can do so much better until Adobe fixes these problems. It's not worth it.",

Features like word definitions, phrase translation, underlining and highlighting in various colors, ability to google and hotlink to places, people and art described in ebooks.  I was a big fan and user for many years of Neosoar another DRM e reader.  Unfortunately, they seem to be recently out business.  It took a while for Neosoar to get to a point of near perfection with these features I’ve listed above.  But the absolute best was your annotations were linked to Dropbox.  So, any additions or notations or hotlinks would be saved in Dropbox.  If you changed or upgraded your e reader you would upload the DRM e book and sync with Dropbox and all your annotations would appear.  You would not lose any annotations. Neosoar is a great loss to those of us need an e reader that is fully connected to power of the internet.  It is unfortunate that ADE does not measure up.  In the future it could if Adobe puts in the effort.",

You can highlight in what appears to be only a single color, bookmark pages, view the table of contents, view all of your highlights and bookmarks, search text, and display content in two (functional) color schemes (white text/black background, and black text/brown background). That’s about it for functionality. Highlights are ugly and are broken up by the spacing between highlighted words. Recommend looking elsewhere; this app isn’t worth its free price tag.",

I also like continuous scrolling for reading instead of having to swipe because it’s a hassle, not to mention if you are reading in a dark/dim space it has to load every page (which takes a bit) and the loading screen is WHITE while I’m reading in dark mode! I honestly can’t believe this is a published app! I wish I could use the books app right on my iPhone for the library materials but sadly I can’t.

The previous format made it easy to highlight, scroll between pages, add notes, clear highlight marks, find the index (a crazy concept now), and overall be able to hold my device while using the app. \tThis recent update has made it feel more like I'm scrolling through my camera roll of screenshots that someone took of book pages than it actually feels like I'm attempting to read a formatted book. The highlighting feature is almost twice as twitchy and jumpy as before, and I find it even harder to remove highlighting that was done by mistake. Not only that, but instead of being able to tap a drop-down menu for the book's index, you now need to tap the screen three or four times before it registers that you don't want to just be in image mode, and that you'd actually like to access another menu. This menu, which was formerly easy to use and access, has been relegated to a very tiny and hard-to-find button in the bottom corner that doesn't always show up. In addition to that frustration, it's much harder to operate than the last menu. \tMy best description of the new update is that they tried to fix something that wasn't really broken, and in doing so just made it worse.",

            "body": "Frustration with iOS 16 disfunction leaves me wondering if the upgrade was tested before being released. I agree with the previous reviewer and won’t re-address those same concerns. However, I will address the book mark and scroll reading  issues.  The slightest touch while scroll reading activates the red book mark which (because I’m reading) needs to be cleared. Sometimes touching the red bookmark is enough to clear it, but other times you have to open the Themes and Settings menu and remove the bookmark there as well. This seems to be more sensitive with iOS 16 than previous versions.  Even more frustrating, though; when using the scroll reading feature near the end of a chapter the (scroll) screen jumps ahead - sometimes paragraphs ahead, sometimes pages ahead, sometimes to the end of the current chapter, or other times to the end of the book. Imagine trying to find where you were reading last when that happens. (An opportunity to use the search feature as long as you have the exact verbiage.)Anyway, to fix the jumping scroll issue I change from scroll to page turning or sometimes I have decreased the font size, and then sometimes I have to close the book because it won’t reload after a font size change. And since the pages are renumbered you can’t just go to your last page and continue reading. Please FIX this bug in the near future. Thank you.",

For starters PLEASE bring back the page turning animation. If I wanted to feel like I’m readim* a spreadsheet at work, I’d read a spreadsheet at work. Next - I Tried to bold fonts to help with my bad eye issues and some portions of the book are in bold, some are not. It’s completely random, sometimes with the bold text stopping in the middle of a paragraph or even middle of a word. Previous books no longer open to my last location, but start at the beginning or random locations in the book, leaving me to flip flip flip flip flip flip back trying to find where I left off. Beyond frustrating. There is a quite long lag when opening a book, often leaving me to wonder if the app has crashed. Not a fan of all the functions relegated to the pop up menu tab instead of being readily available at the top of the screen since I am not happy when I have to have a scavenger hunt just to find basic functions. This was not an “update”. It was a huge step backwards. Someone at Apple really needs to take a course in ui functionality and user friendly interface design. Why change the great things about this app and replace it with this mess?",

If I wait patiently with the app open for 3, 4, 5 minutes (no progress indicator or “syncing” message, you just have to trust it….) eventually things will slowly reappear and I’ll see library items again - though given how random the behavior is, I’m never quite sure if it’s all there. Sometimes the resync never happens and I have to do a ritual of settings changes, restarts, and reinstalls to get it back. The app will aggressively delete local copies of things (presumably to save space, but it’s not like ebooks are very large….), including very recently opened files, which has left me more than once with an empty library over a long flight where I was literally reading something on the train to the airport. Really hard to grok how an app could get basic workflows like “I want to continue reading the book I was reading yesterday” so wrong, but somehow this only seems to work like 25% of the time. The desktop is equally broken, though somehow in slightly different ways. Somehow this would be even slightly excusable if the app had any features at all, but tbh it’s a very basic and utilitarian reader app - it’s simple and would be great if it reliably did the three or four things it sets out to do.",

In the folders where a few are grouped together it prompts me to re-buy the books I ALREADY OWN. I contacted Apple for help with no resolution. As an avid reader with DOZENS of books it is extremely frustrating to have series separated like this! Now, after this new update, the entire app is no longer user friendly. The font, font sizes, spacing, etc. looks awful. Trying to access specific chapters, settings, bookmarks, and the search bar is super inconvenient. And as small as it seems, having to hit the X in the top right corner to get out of the book is just awful. Due to these changes, I am currently moving all of my favorite books and unfinished series over to the kindle app. It’s depressing to rebuy all of my books on another platform simply bc the developers made all of these changes, clearly without even seeking the opinions of those who use this app. It’s disappointing that Apple continues to destroy so many things that were the reason many of us chose to utilize their products. It has been 11.5 years since the loss of a pioneer whose work is slowly being deconstructed by those who took over his company.",

The Books app consistently provides me with a seamless and enjoyable reading experience, and I am truly grateful for your hard work! However, one minor issue I've encountered is that when I read books in the epub format, although I've noticed that the Books app allows for customizing fonts, unfortunately, the selection of fonts provided by the app is a bit limited and doesn't include my preferred ones. I attempted to find a solution through Google but was unsuccessful. The response I received was that the Books app doesn't offer additional font options (sad face). I earnestly request if it would be possible for you to add more font options, preferably allowing the import of TrueType Font files or selecting fonts from the system. Of course, it would be fantastic if I could also choose fonts that I have installed in my system (like Pages, Numbers app). Thank you sincerely! I hope you can accommodate the request of this fervent Apple Books enthusiast. Once again, thank you! Wishing you all the best!",

FIRE THE ENTIRE DESIGN TEAM WHO TOOK ONE OF APPLE’S BEST APPS AND TRASHED IT. Since 2010; I have but using iPads to read all of my books. The design, the layout, was absolutely stellar from the very beginning. The graphics of turning a page made the transition from reading a paper book to a virtual book seamless. But then 2022 came along with the release of the latest iOS for iPads. An apple, with its horrible wisdom decided to hand over this project to someone who obviously has never read a paper book. I am furious. As a loyal Apple user for over 25 years, I am seriously open to other providers not just for reading books; but I am ready to go back to paper books, giving up my Apple Watch for real watch, putting down my iPhone, and maybe even considering going with another type of cell phone that is not an apple. With your meals price increases for Apple services, I’ve already canceled those and I’m ready to give up everything that is Apple. Apples become too greedy without any consideration for its very loyal customers changing books it’s just the latest, possibly the straw that breaks many of our backs interest to taking any more from Apple.

The author’s name hasn’t changed for the series, so the is no reason it can’t consolidate them to one group rather than have each book separated. 2: sometimes when the page, it goes to a blank page. I have to swipe a previous page or two and then go back to the said page. Lastly: both my iPhone 12 and iPad Air app crashes sometimes. Not too sure why this hasn’t been addressed, but it’s been years since the app came out. The more software continues to advance, it should reduce the problems, not create more. Would like to see my money’s worth purchasing books from this app be put to use on updating the app (REAL updates). It would be much appreciated. But I believe my words are being unheard. Some books I pre-ordered are not showing up. When I hit “View Item” it says that the said book is no longer available in this country or region. Mind the fact, that I waited over a month for the book and now I can’t read it. Not too sure if it’s due to technical issues or incompetent functions. All I know is that this app is getting worse and no one is fixing it. My advice to those looking at this app, keep what you got and find another iBook app. This was once at the top of it’s peak and now it’s falling fast.",

Also sometimes when I turn the page and it is a new chapter< I just have blank pages, the only way to rectify this is to close the app and reopen it. Not good enough Apple. Do something about these faults as I cannot afford to rebut all my books on Kindle, nor should I have to. You have made it so these books cannot be read on other tablets so you should ensure that your app works properly and also be more usable by the visually impaired by allowing larger font sizes to be used.",

Why not? I’ve spent hours on a topic and my tracking doesn’t reflect that, nor is there a way to manually adjust this. It’s pretty frustrating to have to download a separate app and manually enter in my tracking when this app is meant to do it automatically for me. Tracking is super important for me and I’m considering other reading apps just because of this. It’s a pretty silly bug that I hope gets updated. A lot of papers and journals are PDF only and I prefer to keep all my reading in one place - I’ll likely stop using this app if the next update doesn’t make it easier to use.",

The brightness is the worst ! Too bright or too dark. I tried to fix it by ebook setting ( bottom corner ), go to main setting of iPad . I did adjust brightness. It’s still not good. Set up accessibility, go to Display & Text size. I tried every single option but it’s all seriously useless. None of it can make all the text in the book looks softer, easier to continue to read.

Design wise, there’s the outer margins, which are often too wide to comfortable scan lines of text, especially on an iPhone mini. Highlighting text is a gamble – sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, sometimes it works but only by half. The themes UI feels like it was an afterthought, clunky and confusing. The menu itself is hidden away behind a non-standard, counterintuitive interface that’s uncharacteristic of Apple’s usual approach to design. And the theme options are overkill. Most of us simply want light or dark modes and the ability to adjust type properties, not a collection of rigid styles. Plus, you can’t even adjust the font size within these themes.

Just change it back and people would like it! The close button and options button is annoyingly hard to make it appear again, the page turning animation is good and now replaced with a trash animation that makes no sense to change to, the button at the bottom is terrible, change it to various button that appear by default. If you leave the new UI, people will be angry!!! So just change!!! I hate the new UI!!! It's so uncomfortable, is ridiculous, and easy to get irritate!!! Congratulations on wasting your time doing a pointless thing only to increase the amount of critical reviews! I hate the new update!

When I'm at my desk I set my phone on it's dock and continue 'reading' while I work and the same goes when I'm cooking.  I use this more than iTunes nowadays.It isn't perfect - I don't download to my phone anymore because usually I get an error message after it's downloaded the first 5-10% of a book, and then just stops - nothing will get a download past the first 10% no matter how I tweak the settings.  So now I just download to my Mac and drop it into iTunes, to load up when I sync next.  It's a bit of a nuisance but....This never used to happen, just since 2 or 3 revisions ago.  I can live with the inconvenience though.    What I couldn't live without now is the App itself - it's so convenient to listen to a book rather than have to give a book your whole attention as with a paper book or eBook - although I read plenty of them too.My only real hate is the ‘dashboard’/home page the app starts on now.

A great critique of the promise of blockchain and digital coins and how they were usurped by con artists and the dream of decentralisation way just a parting dream. It’s a sorrow tale for left who dreamed of a post capitalist rebirth of the socialist system. That is dead the power now more than ever resides in the hands of tech bros and fewer nation states to set the rule of the future.

Although I would say sometimes when I’m trying to skip or back it doesn’t let me so that’s one downside but otherwise this app is amazing. Another thing to mention is that if you want to get a monthly ticket or credit to use for a book or podcast you should do it. It’s quite cheap and it actually works and it’s actually pretty good to do because it some of the books that are already free on Audible they don’t normally they aren’t that good in my opinion so I would suggest highly buying the monthly credit thing.",

This app has changed my life I recommend it to all of my friends regularly and with the subscription you get a new book each month. One suggestion I would have for the makers is possibly adding an option to buy credits in bulk for cheaper prices, sometimes I want to read a new series of books but find myself not wanting to waste credits/$15 on books between 5-10 hours as I can finish that in a day or so, if I had the option to buy more in one go I wouldn’t find myself skipping series that have shorter books at the beginning.

Given the large number of books on Audible there are bound to be more customised options available  3) I am often interested in series which are very old like Clive Cusslers Dirk Pitt, Wilbur Smith’s Courtney’s, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan’s. All of these titles cost the same as a new book even though many are decades old and no longer on the best sellers list. I, and many others, would be tempted to buy whole series at a discount or buy one at full price and the rest 50% off, or 2 for a credit.4) Last but not least. I am not one bit interested in LGBT or Australian Aboriginal literature. Many of my favourite books have characters or content which deals with these however it is not front and centre. How Audible pushes books with a pure focus on this content on their clients I find frustrating and reprehensible. Your role is to provide compelling content to all of your clients not force fringe content, relevant to a few, on everyone in an transparent effort to appear progressive and righteous.",

If you are looking for ways to ‘be the change you want to see in the world’ and ‘treat others the way you would like to be treated’ here is an great parenting manual for finding ways to do just that, starting in your home.This audiobook brings together the key elements of NVC, collaborative problem solving, unconditional parenting and social justice parenting in a beautifully presented, easy to understand way.I recommend this book to every parent, it truly has something to offer everyone. If you wish to parent differently to how you were parented, this book will help you tread your own path. If you were parented in a respectful way that aligns with your values this book will provide insight into why it can STILL be hard to let go of 'power over' parenting in times of stress. If you currently parent in an authoritarian way this book provides solid research based reasons to consider the alternatives. Even if you read this book and find it is not for you, it will certainly provide food for thought.I found the content that spoke directly to healing damaging patriarchal, capitalist and racist systems (insidious in W.E.I.R.D. societies) super beneficial. I will refer back to this book whenever I perceive a potential disconnect between my parenting and my values.I can’t wait for a book number 2!",

            "body": "Thanks so much to all who endeavoured to put All Black history into such a magnificent book. I was genuinely sad to reach the end. Having moved to NZ from Canada in 2007, I first fell in love with the game watching them play SA in a little pub in Ohakune where so many fans packed the room, it felt like when Canada played Russia in ice hockey. It was there that I first saw grown men fly through the air to victory. I watched sportsmanship that saw the foulest call by a ref, not even register distain on Richie McCaw’s face because he was already getting in position for the next play. There was a physicality to the game but there more skill than I’d ever seen on field of any other game. This book puts into words the journey we all took while Sir Steve Hansen was at the helm. It will always be topical for the game and whether you played or are a fan, you will find it FASCINATING!!!",

I love how there is brand new and popular books on here, and you also don’t have to wait like you might on Libby. In terms of the app, I wish you could purchase through the app. I wish that you could change the timer to view the percentage you were through the book, and that the overall progress timer was visible on books that were loaded in 2 parts. Finally, I wish that there were cost effective subscriptions for multiple books per month as I read maybe 2 audiobooks a week and find that Audible gets expensive so I rotate between this, Libby (which is connected to your library card, meaning that it’s free BUT they will only have a certain amount of copies of a book and you need to wait until a copy is available - like a normal library book - which can be loooong with new or popular books but has a STUNNING app interface that I believe is more intuitive than Audible), and less frequently I’ll listen to Scribd but the selection is average compared to either of the first two I choose and the app isn’t as pleasant as even Audible. Overall, I love Audible because of the range and I would keep it purely based off of that however I also enjoy the interface and the experience of the books. Overall, I",

Rich descriptions of his childhood in Dartford, detailed a seeming no man’s land of post war Britain trying to find its way from the old to the new. Keith’s guiding lights were the Chicago blues artists, who faded in and faded out across the Atlantic airways through the antennae of his transistor radio. Together with the influence of his musical family, and a chance meeting with Mick Jagger (who lived in a posher part of town) a partnership was forged that became the Rolling Stones. Keith rambles at times, yet he rambles with a fierce hearted loyalty and insight into the populace of musicians, women, staff and personalities, who came and went from his life; some of whom who also shaped the face of the sixties and seventies. It’s a gripping tale. I loved hearing Keith speak himself - such a rich, gravelly and warm voice - a welcome relief from the monotony of Depp’s narration and the south London accented overkill of the second narrator.",

It’s a good service if you can’t find time to read yourself or just need to relax and listen to a book. If you try and cancel the service, boy are you in for a rough ride. For a start you can’t do this via the mobile app and have to go through their website. When you do eventually find the section and go through with it, there are no guarantees that you won’t continue to be billed. I cancelled and despite my membership saying it’s not active now as well as a confirmation email I was still charged at the end of the following month. Cancelled 21st Feb, membership officially ended on the 3rd of March I believe and then charged again on the 31st. You go through their first call option which is some sort of online call (after fighting disheartened through more roundabouts of help options) and the call just cancels after a few minutes of waiting, repeatedly. Try the toll free number and well guess what, it says it is not currently active!!! Classic scam warning signs but Audible isn’t a scam. I cancelled cause I don’t have a job now but I’m waiting to see whether some of my food money will disappear at the end of this month if I get charged again. Not happy!!",

He started telling me good morning, good morning, good morning! I thought the dude was a super human! And over time of getting up early!      My whole world changed.

The idea of earning a credit a month to use for any premium item also fine. I had accumulated four credits, when I decided to take a break . Now this is the problem, and in reality it is my fault for not reading the fine print. I THOUGHT that I would take a few months off of the membership to use credits that have been building up. Fully planning on rejoining in a few months time. What I did not realize was that once you suspend the membership you lose all of your accumulated credits .. back to zero. If you seek out this information you will find it. I never looked at the whole contract . Kind of silly to pay monthly and then lose all of you credits if you stop temporarily or otherwise.. Without this issue Audible is a five star company, but this nickel and diming was and is unfair, stated or not , fine print or not. So this is a cautionary tale. If you are a member  or plan on becoming one be advised that if you stop your membership you will lose all of you amassed credits. If you are the type of person that uses the credit immediately, then you are fine. Otherwise heed the warning. You will get your credits erased too.",

It was actually very simple, but I couldn’t figure out how before, and had even contacted Audible Help (before I wrote the review) but the rep said Alexa couldn’t be removed. So I’m very happy again with this app. And I’d like the Alexa button if it were in a different location in car mode. Here’s my original review:The new Alexa button is annoying, and frankly, a little dangerous. I used to be able to hit the \"rewind\" and \"bookmark\" buttons in car mode without looking down at my screen while driving. Now I have to look at the screen to hit those buttons because otherwise I accidentally hit that HUGE Alexa button at the bottom of the screen. (Which interrupts my book.) Super frustrating. Sure, I could use the Alexa button instead, but it takes longer to hit the button and say \"rewind 10 seconds\" than just hitting the rewind button like I used to be able to easily do. The Alexa button isn't a bad idea, but why couldn't they have put it somewhere else, and not make it so big? This has ruined the app for me. I sure hope they fix this terrible design in future updates. I’ll gladly change my 2 star rating to a 4 or 5 if they do.",

Way too many suggestions and advertised books for an app. It’s not a clean look and honestly it’s ugly. The app needs a more sleek minimalist feel for ease of use. I literally get anxiety seeing the homepage with all the extra books recommendations, catalogues and so forth. When I use the app I just want to get to the point not be defaulted to a crazy looking page foot of book images. Please higher someone to update your app comestically. With the IOS update people are discovering less is more with widgets and less apps. Try to use that same concept, I want to see recommendations make it the last tab not the first. Have the first tab be the library and instead of a line chart of books maybe give the option of line display or chart display, just something more sleek please.Update 03 May 2021: The app skips the audio for some reason and when the screen goes dark it stops playing.

It was fine on my old iPhone 11 Pro Max. I have reflex sympathetic dystrophy, I can no longer hold books or write. So using Audible is so important to me when it comes to the Bible. Use daily and take notes through the app. The app even encourages customers to download all in one file. That’s great, but it doesn’t work anymore for books larger then GB. If anyone like me you have larger libraries, this means can’t even use higher quality downloads on many books. But it’s getting ridiculous the way Audible has gotten lazy. It happens every other year with iOS update and app updates. It either wipes out all of your downloads, or it breaks the app to be able to download. I’ve been at the premium level since 2012, I can’t count the times I’ve bought three extra credits a month. When they had their reading challenges last year, had the amount listened to in a week. I love this app, but I need it to work at the level it has for so many years before. Need this to be addressed and fixed. I can call again and be told sorry, and given extra credits.

Jill had a rough upbringing and then a traumatic event happens in their lives which leads to Jill being unattached and distant, as well as, having a hard time relating to many people.The second part of the book is where it picks up. Someone takes Sophia. We also get more into another character, Bea, who has a lot to do with, well everything. I won’t divulge because it would reveal too much.

I have being able to perform labor tasks or even play video games which take up a different response sector from my ability to focus, perform, absorb and respond. While I can divide my attention, this nifty app allows me to focus on both my physical labor and the text/ideas being shared here with the same intensity and similar results. The narrators so far have been great, their tempo, punctuation and emphasis has been on point. The variety of works from which to chose is broad and so far I have found most if not all of the books I wanted to read/listen to. Also, the fact that Audible provides free credits every so often is remarkable( imagine not only how much money is saved but also time to travel and shop for these. Not to mention what if they are difficult to find provided their less then popular demand). The features to control the speed of the narration, also the ability to play on the background for if in the midst of listening one should attend a communication from a friend or family and not want to disturb the suspense built on the best part of the book.   Also, I am sure there are other features I have not explored. So this is it for this review being. Thank you 🙏",

This is a wonderful ethic that Audible has that very few other companies do. I have over 1000 books in my library, and I’ve been with Audible using its application since about the year 2000. I joined Audible not expecting much… But they have proof to be a company that is responsive and one that cares very much about their users.The Audible app has become indispensable to me, and I can only say that about one or two other apps, among many on my phone. It simply works, and works well. My favorite feature is that it organizes series in their chronologically released order. This means that you can see immediately in your library if you’ve missed one in a long series of books that you enjoy, and can usually immediately purchase it right through the app.Audible, I am retired now, but I look forward to many years of listening pleasure, and it’s all possible because you’ve made such a wonderfully accessible and useful application. Thank you, and please keep up the good work.John Esak.",

            "body": "I love audible, it’s easily my favorite app and really the only reason I use my phone for anything other than communication. The price is more than reasonable, for $15 you get access to a lot of really solid books, plus a credit to use on any book you want, no matter the price. Depending on their age and popularity, some books can be upwards of $30 by themselves, so that’s a pretty sweet deal. Credits carry over and, as long as you keep your membership, they will not expire (if you cancel, be sure to use any left over credits before you do). My only advice is to check the book’s price before you use a credit on it. As I said before, a credit is good for any price book, but that also goes for inexpensive books. They don’t make it easy to see the actual cost, I have to use my phone’s browser because they don’t show you within the app, but there have been books I want that are only $2-3, which would be a total waste of a credit, so I just buy them with my credit card. The only con for me would be (as of December 2022, at least) is the poor compatibility with iOS, you can’t use Siri for any commands other than rewind/play/pause/forward. Since I listen with my AirPods most of the time, it would be nice, but I guess I understand with the whole Alexa vs. Siri war.",

Definitely giving the app 5 stars overall! I LOVE my audiobooks. Audible was one of my very top used apps, as I have a hard time focusing on tasks around the house/work/etc without some sort of sensory input. I have it running almost all the time. The last update ruined the whole app for me. I live way out in the middle of nowhere with no wifi and only the most tenuous connection to the data network. Suddenly, after updating the app, it won’t play any of my DOWNLOADED titles without an internet connection. What the heck is the point of taking up my phone storage space downloading all these books, if I now can’t even play them from my phone?? I am so disappointed, as I can’t listen to any of my favorite books at home anymore because I can’t find a place to connect enough to start the chapter. I know I’m just one random human to a huge corporation, but please, please, please, fix this. I am already missing my books acutely. It’s so disappointing to not be able to play my selection of downloaded books.",

            "body": "This app is very poor, especially compared to Tidal. When I first started with Tidal, it’s library was modest, but now it is Apple that is lagging, at least with artists that I like. The Apple Music app is not intuitive. It is hard to find music- it’s easier to find music in the ‘Sleep’ genre than Jazz! I gather that their song/artist recommendations are poor too (in Tidal they’re excellent). Your ability to customise your home screen is non existent. For example, why do I have to see ‘kids corner’? For someone who doesn’t have kids (or who wants to but cannot) this is annoying/depressing. The creators of the Apple Music app seem obsessed with playlists. It’s easier find out what other people are listening to (top charts, curated playlists etc) than to find things that I like or might be interested in! It is bizarre!Speaking of bizarre, my library has artists and albums from iTunes days, and newly favourited albums. But newly-favourites artists? Oh no, sorry they’re under the ‘listen now’ section. So despite innovations like the expansion of Lossless and the addition of Spatial Audio, it’s still junk. It’s like selling some of the best ice cream in the world from a recently used abattoir that has a dubious hygiene record. Hope this helps others’ decisions.",

For the playlist feature, when you press the song being played and the previously played and up next songs pop up, the top of that screen is too close the activation area for opening the notifications slide down page. The result is that whenever I’m attempting to close the playlist page by sliding it down, I open my notifications page - simply less user friendly. Please restore these features to their older formats and have a few more trial testers before releasing this sort of failed update.Additionally, when I click the suggest less songs like this, the button should simultaneously function as a skip song button. Why would I ask the system to suggest less songs like that and continue listening to the song? Pandora had this figured a decade ago.",

Also, my Apple Music app on my TV, which prior to the subscription would play music in my Apple library, now no longer accesses my playlist or any songs purchased and downloaded without re-signing up for a subscription. So Apple Music on my TV is useless at this point without a subscription. My Apple Music playlists on my iPhones, TV, iTunes, and iPad was deleted, literally erasing hours of work. I did figure out that I could re-sync my iPhone and iPad devices with iTunes on my computer and get the playlists back. However, my Samsung TV Apple Music app now requires a subscription to access my library to access previously purchased songs and playlist. This is incredibly non-customer service oriented. I also did a trial of the Apple TV subscription and Now, I’m concerned about what Apple may do to my Apple TV movies when that subscription expires. I guess I should have just left it alone and not signed up for the trial subscription.

Very often you have to hit play once or twice a song to keep it going, which is extremely cumbersome when you’re listening to music in the shower or running; you have to stop what you’re doing every few minutes to keep it working. When out walking it holds a connection for about half an hour and if you skip more than 3 or 4 songs it completely quits loading. I’m in the greater Phoenix area and the cellular signal is great. This model iPhone is less than 2 years old, this shouldn’t be happening. The service is so jenky it’s almost not worth paying for anymore. Sticking to playlists instead of stations helps, but it would better if the app could just operate like it’s supposed to.Also the algorithm has trouble gauging what to play next. It’s like it can’t tell that you’re listening to all up beat, fast music and slow music is skipped, it just keeps pushing slow music. When I get off work I like to go running, at the same time every day I look for upbeat music to put myself in the mindset. It would be great if the algorithm could pick up on that and suggest more accordingly. The pop station is probably my favorite but it takes a lot of skipping and hitting play to keep it going, and at best it’ll only work part of the time. It’s almost easier to just turn on the radio.",

This also makes it impossible to find duplicate tracks within your playlists. Second, there is no option to delete multiple songs within a playlist at once - it has to be done song by song, which is absurd. No option to delete multiple albums at once, either. What is Apple’s aversion to letting the user do this? Third, when you are playing a song, there is an option to “go to album” but no option to “go to artist,” which is irritating. Apple Music looks great and sounds great, but it’s not user-friendly in the way it needs to be. Right now, I’m only using it because it comes free in a family plan from a relative.

If so, I have attempted to counteract it by clearing all histories. Also, none of the songs are on repeat mode, so this is not the problem. I am not sure what more to do; this is very frustrating, and I have talked to other users who share the same issue. Could there be an option to where every song must play, no matter how many times I shuffle, before being repeated? This may sound dumb because one would assume that I should merely stop pressing the Shuffle button and resume the last song played, but in order to access other Apple Music appliances and play other playlists, this is not plausible. Therefore, there should be a new button: Resume Shuffle!! This in addition to the already Shuffle button (so users can still mix things up), will create a much more enjoyable experience on Apple Music!! I am certain that other users will agree with me.",

Firstly, it's great Apple pays artists more to record this way. It would be a win/win situation except for actually finding the music in the catalog. I surmise that aside from the artists getting paid better, this also gives them store front exposure. For artists with older offerings it rekindles interest in their work. However, with the exception of playlists Apple has put together, many of these recordings remain buried … often with no description of them being done in Spacial Audio or double copies of the same recording. Sometimes you can find a whole Album if you root around but you must continually be persistent especially when only one song by an artist is done this way. The existing Search function is no help either. This is unfair to artists and makes finding content tedious and time consuming. This does not encourage people to adopt this newer way of listening. When one considers the minority of people who many have the equipment to take of advantage of this, it seems counterintuitive to have speed bumps encumbering discovery.",

If I pay for the service, and tell it what I want to watch, it should *NOT* then force an advertisement for some other show on me.The ads are skippable (this is new since I last had the app a couple years ago), but this is a big hassle on ChromeCast as you’re not sitting there with the app open waiting for the ad so you can skip it.Maybe play ads once someone’s show has ended so they can find something else, but not before playing the show I literally just asked to be played.

Maybe this is a change but it’s too much work to look for what I’m already paying for. Also huge con that they don’t offer Peacock but I’m sure if I purchased their channel, it would be the same thing.

The ads were horrendous.  To the point that I decided to bite the bullet and pay the overloads their penance.  So paying the 2.99 didn’t affect the ads in the slightest.  And the ads weren’t positioned where the ad breaks are in the show. Middle of a gunfight boom 5 minutes of ads.  After painfully finishing 1883 I started to rethink everything. I canceled Paramount + and have considered canceling prime. Let me be clear. Ads are the worst and there is nothing more triggering. If I wanted to watch ads I can watch any of the free services with ads. If I’m paying nearly 200 dollars a year for a streaming service I’d better not have a hint of an ad.  I will try subscribing to paramount + in the future through Apple TV. But if it has ads as well I might have to leave Paramount behind. The idea of buying shows seems like a much better idea at this point. Not much discovery but my generation hates ads.  Buying digital seems a scam as well even though it’s the most convenient.

It is really annoying to have to turn on the subtitles every-time i leave the app, or whenever a new episode starts (sometimes it works most of the time they turn off) I would really appreciate if there was just a setting to have the subtitles stay in for everything they’re available for. other than that the originals are great and the video quality is as-well, if you are also someone who relies on subtitles keep in mind that they can be very annoying at times.",

After being bounced to several people, I got the standard uninstall and reinstall the app and restart ipad. Neither worked.  Tried to report again and once more bounced to several different people in chat. They seem to be unwilling to report as a new bug when they fail to solve the issue.  Their work around is to go to web address to access purchased movies/shows given My Stuff/purchases is broken. Alternative if you remember every purchase you can use search feature to find it and finally have the option to play.  No more purchases until they get this fixed. The work arounds are annoying and take more time when it worked before the update.F on the last update and D- on chat experience.",

And even worse, the app crashes a lot when I hit skip, or just kick me to the Home Screen of the app. And maybe it wouldn’t bother me as much if you didn’t constantly push paid-for content and makes it more difficult than it should to filter the shows included with subscription. While The Grand Tour and The Tick are easily some of the best shows here, the latter is a HUGE example of missed opportunity through the lack of pushing. Even buying and watching super hero and comedy shows before finding The Tick myself, it never once showed up in suggestions. And that’s one of YOUR shows that I couldn’t find until a YouTuber mentioned it existed, off hand, in a video about something else entirely. So many missed opportunity and problems within the app, and the ads are just the Cherry on top that made me wanna rant about my gripes with the service.",

There is only 1 user account which makes watching shows more difficult if a family member watches the same show. There is no like/dislike button so the same content shows up even if you already watched it and content that you have no interest in shows in the recommended list. The recently added list shows the same content month after month. There is a lot of bad movies but there are some hidden gems in there, but the app makes it difficult to find.

This man’s response to me was “use the mobile app” and when I said I can’t watch on my tv he said “no you have to pay 7.99 for another screen” So I have to pay extra for a service because I travel for work and want my child to be able to watch at home still? This is how you treat customers that have been with you for years? I hear you loud and clear Netflix. Paying for 2 screens is not enough for you, you need more from me. I think you will find this move, and the way you are having your representatives address this with customers (rude and dismissive quite frankly) will be the end of your company. No amount of original content games or reruns will entice people to pay for your app, when there are much better services out there for a lot less money. I actually think I pay in total for 4 other services for what you were going to charge me for your service in both of my locations. I hope you will learn from this mistake, but I don’t think you will. Congrats on being the new blockbuster!",

Everything works beautifully and it’s easy to search for what you’re looking for and the list of saved shows is fine too. My big issue, however, is with the currently watching area on the tv app, phone app, and website. Sure there are tons (and I mean TONS) of articles all over the web giving instructions on how to remove shows from the currently watching section that you no longer want to view, but Netflix it’s your job to provide an easier method for doing this. It’s unrealistic to expect people to go into their history and delete a millions episodes of a show just to get to the movies and whatever other shows they need to remove from that section. Just allow a space on the titles to remove them from that area. Especially for shows or movies that you try out and end up not liking. They stay there for months! Also, the app on tv plays the show or movie just when you’re trying to read the info about it and guess what?? That also adds that title to currently watching! Fix this issue please! It’s 2020! We shouldn’t have to google the hundreds of articles teaching people how to get around your archaic ways with this one thing. Do better, Netflix.",

There are so many options.One thing, though. There are some inappropriate shows that show up on even a kids profile. My mom still makes me use a kids profile because of all the inappropriate shows about nudity, drugs, etc and shows with swearing and stuff. It still shows up even on that profile. Just not as much. But could you please have that stuff ONLY on adult profiles? I don’t like seeing it, and I’d rather have a Watch Together profile, and still not see it much. My little siblings—we’re talking toddlers here—see that stuff on their profiles too. I really would like it if you didn’t have all of that.But Netflix is mostly amazing, which is why I gave it five stars, though it was close to four stars because of the inappropriate show stuff. The search bar is so easy to search stuff up, and downloading is nice too (BUT PLEASE MAKE BUNK’D DOWNLOADABLE!!!!!!!). Netflix is cool yo. 😎",

(I do not know if this feature is added) You should also add a feature that locks episodes or movies so your kids cannot watch them. 4. You should sort movies and shows by ratings like PG 13 will go in a row and TV MA there. 5. You should finish some shows. In Netflix most shows are left behind with like 3 seasons but the real show has 8. 6. You should be able to delete movies and shows from the continue list. It is so annoying. 7. Also you may wanna put a lock on PG 13 and TV 14 and TV MA  and rated R and you have to enter a pin and your face so they will know you are not young. 8. You should put a list of shows and movies that you do not like and they won’t be visible to you anymore. 9. You should put a swear word censor on the kids account or Adult account it will be in audio and subtitles. 10. No kids should watch inappropriate stuff and I been seeing on the kids profiles.

I will say navigation is better on mobile than a computer - on computers when you get suggested titles there’s no easy way to rate what you’ve already watched and yet in both places that presents a problem within itself - if I’ve already watched something I wish you would remove it from the rows of shows and movies and the better way to do this would be to have a previously rated section where all these already rated shows can live. With all the content Netflix has the cluster of what you call organization is a huge turn off and I find myself using the platform less because of it. Also, Netflix basically birthed the term binging so I also hate when you try to be like traditional cable and release shows by date - whoever decided this was a good idea - you don’t understand a competitive advantage when you have one as no one really likes having to tune in weekly if they also had the option of just watching all the way thru (time permitting of course). Again you’ve managed to take a competitive advantage and found a way to regress to be like everyone else. Sometimes people try too hard and overlook the easy reasons why they are losing subscribers and a lot of it has to do with when you lose those core things that made you great.",

But keep the resume button as well. People prob. want both! Would also like to remove the rating thumbs off of the screen while watching. It was fine where it was. I understand it helps y’all know what to keep as well as I’m sure it helps the algorithm to suggest shows I may be interested but I actually want to press it less now that it’s in my way. A section geared toward teens would be awesome! Not just young children. Lastly, I would also love an “Expiring Soon” section & also add a little notification as well when clicking on something to watch. Nothing I hate more than when I go to watch something & find it’s no longer on Netflix even though I added it to my watchlist within weeks or even days….Had I known, I would have watched sooner!

I finally cancelled my membership due to the emotional distress this has caused me on several occasions. I have pretty severe depression and the lack of accommodation for this disability is quite disappointing. I consistently use the same devices to watch Netflix and yet they still have to be reverified every month. I’ve notified them on multiple occasions of the issue and nothing is done. Sad to cancel but I can no longer handle this extra source of stress in my life. It already costs too much money as it is.

For example, there are plenty of shows that are rated TV-MA and don’t have nudity that are great to watch. However, you have to filter them all yourself and check the rating before hand and it takes up a lot of time when looking for something new to view. Now, imagine if I can just go to me settings page and toggle on and off certain tags to make my browsing easier by removing shows/movies with the tag from appearing during your browsing. Now I know that doing it with every single tag would be a pain in the behind but just doing the major tags would help out a lot of people I think.I also, want to explain what I mean by tag in the case it isn’t clear.

This has made my watching experience unpleasant and I find myself watching shows on Netflix as a last resort when the shows or movies can’t be found anywhere else. I have tried many things in order to solve problem such as, disconnecting and reconnecting my WiFi, and uninstalling and reinstalling the app, none of these Methods have done anything to improve the functionality of the app. Also, this problem isn’t limited to just me, someone else I know happens to own a ROKU TV and is experiencing the exact same problems. I don’t understand selling to a company that is not compatible with your services nor do I have any interest in continuing to give you a monthly fee for inadequate and lagging services. I suggest you fix this before you lose more customers like me. I would recommend others do the same, and support rival companies who can provide adequate service for the same price or less.",

The reason why this is a problem is that I find myself watching Netflix less and less as I find there’s no reason to watch a show and get interested when chances are it will be cancelled. And it seems unfair that shows such as big mouth, paradise PD and others get 6 or so seasons whereas other shows only get 2. Both shows are ok in their own right but it is my belief that the resources are being distributed unfairly amongst the shows. Netflix is by no means the only streaming service that does this but they are by far the worse perpetrator.

            "body": "Everything had been working very well for years.   But then at the beginning of February 2024 I updated the app.  Big mistake!  Of course, the software designers have to mess around with things.  Don’t they always, in a pathetic attempt to justify their existence?  This time they took away the Downloads tab from the bottom of the screen, for reasons best known to them.  But that was nothing compared to the disaster they created.  All the downloads which I already had but which had expired, I was unable to renew them.  Forever and ever I was presented with the error message \"you have downloads on too many devices…\"  This had never happened before.  Not only that, but I couldn’t download anything.  After many calls to customer service I had to delete all those downloads and start all over again.  That is the kind of outcome customrw are presented with when a company chooses to employ incompetent software designers.  Hours wasted because of app upgrades that are worse than useless.Netflix spends a fortune on programming.  Well, it’s about time they made sure that any app upgrade is absolutely faultless before they present it to its overcharged customers.If I could give this app zero stars I would.  One is too many.  The Prime Video app has always been much, much easier to use, and after this experience with the Netflix app I’ll probably delete my account.",

            "body": "Personally, I love Netflix. It’s just a wide variety of movies, TV shows and more at your disposal. But there’s a couple of glitches I want to discuss.The first one is that sometimes when I’m watching a show when I finish my episode it might cause something I call the ‘Set Episode Glitch’. Basically after finishing another episode when I press ‘Next Episode’ it goes to the episode that’s locked in the glitch. It eventually auto corrects itself about a week later.Secondly, there’s the ‘Infinite Intro Glitch’. Sometimes when I press ‘Skip Intro’, it loads for a long time and then goes right back to the start. Then every button except the exit one brings it to the start again.The last one is the ‘Forever Loading Glitch’ where after skipping the intro it has the loading icon, but this is more annoying than experience ruining.Please try to fix these or at least have a look into them when you can and thank you to everyone reading this! :D",

The other is how buggy the store is. If you apply filters and look at a game that interests you, the filters reset. Not to mention you cant see the price of games UNTIL you click on the game, reseting yours filters. Sometimes the page would just randomly reset the filters and you’re back at the start of the page. Want to choose what page you were at? Too bad you have to keep pressing load more to view more games. These are just the bugs that come to mind for now but theres many more.",

At first it wouldn’t let me in at all, then after disabling the app based authenticator and logging out on all devices, I can now get in, but nothing works. Everything I try to do now causes the app to attempt to verify my login, then times out. And every time I close the app, I’m logged out entirely again.  I can still log in on my pc and phone’s browser with zeros issues, so the app is definitely the issue. I’ve tried reinstalling it multiple times, and even logging in with different accounts, and the result is the same — the app is fried.I filed a ticket, so we’ll see what support has to say, but given the lack of support other users are getting with this buggy mess of an app, I’m not hopeful.

You’re still “logged in” using the old password, but since your password has changed nothing works because your credentials are wrong. It also won’t let you log out because the authenticator is active. This problem continues even after you remove the authenticator from your account using a browser.For as much money as steam has you’d think they could afford to pay someone with competence to not have everything fall apart when you try to simply change your password.

Buttons to accept Steam Guard confirmations don’t fit on the screen and the app can’t be properly used. Landscape mode also works on phones, even though it really should only work on iPads. If you try to tilt your phone sideways on the Steam Guard screen, things get crazy. And the notch blocks things as well.I also wish the video player would be fixed too, you have to tap where you think the unmute button is, and then tap to go fullscreen, but you just get a black window. You then have to close the video and re enter it repeatedly until it works in fullscreen, which is very aggravating. This is on iOS 15 on an iPhone 12.",

Often times I will be wanting to wishlist or buy games and the icons simply won’t register being clicked and it isn’t very clear that clicking on a title vs clicking on the thumbnail will warrant a different result.

When I sign into my account I see all their games and tools. When they sign into their account, that’s being deleted, they see only two games, mine.

A lot of people seemed to lean to the scam part but what I noticed was that a lot of the complaints seemed to be things that were explicitly stated in the description of the item. For example, a lot of people were surprised because after purchasing their book their realised that they had to install Adobe Digital Editions if they wanted to read on their computer, and they were annoyed by that, which was reflected on their review of the site. The problem is that if you scroll down the description page of your desired Ebook, everything is laid out for you in a very comprehensive way.Seeing that, I decided to purchase the Ebook, and it was delivered right away. With Adobe, it is now on my computer, easily accessible to me for all time. Everything is working well and I'm delighted with my purchase :)",

Having said that, you can use their reader - I've had a poke round it and it looks simple and well-designed but I like ereaders and don't have a tablet, so I just download the epubs. They use ADE for DRM, which is the worst software from the worst software company, but there's nothing they can do about that: Adobe have a monopoly on epub sales and it's still preferable to using Amazon.Other than that, it's a decent website with an efficient search facility and I can usually find what I want in one search. For browsing, it's as good as any books website and doesn't try to direct your choices. That tendency to push particular product was what made me look for an alternative to Kobo, and ebooks.com is much better for just drifting through webpages, looking for an interesting title.I'm pretty happy with them. I read paper books as well - I can recommend thehive.co.uk for them - so I don't buy as many ebooks as some people, but I've been spending a lot of  time on the site, planning my next series read after I finish Val McDermid, and it has become a favourite website.All in all, I thoroughly recommend them.",

This way I can load my books from ebook.com on my Kindle (which... as much as hate to admit it is the still the best reader) without having to invest in Jeff's off world exit strategy. It's one more step but it's really not very difficult. To be honest having multiple propriety ebookstores and readers was really annoying.

The ebooks you download have to be used with \"Adobe Digital Edition,\" which requires you to make an Adobe membership and then \"authorize\" the program with your membership on your computer just to open any of the books you attempt to download. DRM will not allow you to simply download a book and open it like a PDF. However, the real problem is that MY BOOK WOULDN'T OPEN! I downloaded the book and tried to open it with my authorized Digital Editions, and it would simply say \"Errors were encountered in this item.\" I searched online for solutions, and only found that - yup - sometimes it just doesn't work! So I reached out to ebooks.com to ask for a refund, and was told they'd be happy to give me credit or an actual refund, but that they'd first like the specific error I received. By this point I had uninstalled Digital Editions (didn't need a useless program around), so I had to go back and reinstall it. Only now, Digital Editions wouldn't authorize under my adobe account! I told them this, and sent them a screenshot showing this new error, again asking for my refund. They replied back with a link telling me what to do to solve this new, 2nd issue, then insisted my problem was resolved and closed my help ticket. Um, NO! I was able to get Digital Editions to authorize again, but it STILL WON'T OPEN MY BOOK! My original problem - the thing I contacted them about - has been completely ignored. It has now been several days, and several emails later and they are simply ignoring me. Avoid ebooks.com at all costs - do not buy anything from them, as not only is the basic process a nightmare, but if something doesn't work and you insist on a refund, they will just start to ignore you.",

I downloaded the reader expecting ‘standard’ functionality. The highlight and search functions do not work. Customer Service response to my email with a link to a document and an ‘it’s resolved’ statement. The ‘linked document’ did not provide a resolution. The issue is still not resolved. My advice thus far is to take your business elsewhere until eBooks 1- develop a decent reader and 2 - provide ‘customer service’ not ‘poor service’.",

It took me around an hour on Linux to break through the DRM just so that I can have a regular ePub that I can copy to any devices without having to have Adobe Digital Editions or other proprietary software installed.The system doesn't serve its purpose of preventing theft since now I could (not that I will) upload the ePub for anybody in the world to read free of charge. It just ends up being a pain for the end user who paid for a book and makes Linux users more likely to just download illegally since it is so much more convenient.Paying for a product should provide a smoother and better experience than illegally downloading it, which eBooks.com fails to provide.Reply to eBooks: I've bumped my rating by 1 star thanks to your response. I see that you understand the issues with DRM and that it isn't a solution to piracy. That said I still have to review the service as a whole and to be honest it's a hassle to use the service when the majority of the books are DRM encrypted, regardless of whether that is your fault or not",

I have made an exception in the case of eBooks.com.After posting an initital unfavourable review on Tustpilot.com, I was repeatedly contacted by eBooks.com asking me for information so that they could process a refund of my purchase.I did not reply to the first few requests, but due to their continued requests, I did eventually provide one eBooks.com employee with the sought after information.  While I never heard from that eBooks.com employee again, I was soon contacted by Trustpilot.com informing me that eBooks.com was challenging the veracity of my review and the fact that I'd ever bought anything from them.  This was after I'd sent eBooks.com my invoice number. Trustpilot.com let me know that my review had been suspended until I provided proof of my purchase from eBooks.com.  I have provided Trustpilot.com with that proof and my review has since been reinstated.  However, I am left waiting for the refund eBooks.com appeared so eager to process.As I said previously, I am not one for submitting online reviews, but as a matter of principle I thought it necessary to inform others about this company and its products. Do yourself a big favour and get your ebooks elsewhere.Note to Stephen: I have 2 sent email reciepts in my inbox, both were recieved by eBooks com.  Do you require proof of these also?  I find your response utterly disingenuous.  I appreciate your response to the complaint I logged on your website, but I do not understand why it was posted to Trustpilot.com and not sent to me directly.I refuse to deal with Ebooks.com any further.  I am no longer seeking a refund of my purchase.Please refrain from any further contact either directly or through Trustpilot.com.",

After making a purchase, the reader is given two options to read the book - a download link, and an in-browser pop-up window. From what i can tell, the download link is completely broken. They make it very clear that they want you to download their reader app before you download the book, and while the book is labeled \".ePub\" on the site, the file you actually get is just garbled junk. Completely unusable.The in-browser pop-up window works, but only that. The software legit looks like it's from around 1995, and the loading of pages can be very slow (sometimes they don't load at all). The scrolling bar is very imprecise, and the extra features (such as the \"search this book\" function) also only work when they want to.

            "body": "I was locked out of my account, but all it said was “incorrect password or username”, even though I know it was correct. I asked for a reason and wasn’t given one. It felt as if they were literally laughing at and bullying me, sending stamp-plate copypasta replies and repeatedly sending the same request for my bank card information I had already given twice. When the responses were written by a human,  they were the MOST condescending and insultingly crappy messages I’ve ever received from any customer service department in my entire life.Eventually I was able to fix it on my own (I guess, since I was never actually informed of what the issue was…) by logging in and resetting my password on a different computer after setting up steam guard to send a confirmation code to my phone, but STILL wasn’t told why my account was “locked” in the first place. Even though I asked 4 times by now. They just completely dodged any relevant questions about my account and continued to stall and do basically nothing to actually help. When I mentioned that their lack of response or respect was incredibly distressing and panic-inducing, as I’ve spent plenty of money on my games that I can’t just re-buy, they sarcastically referred me to the freaking suicide hotline…yeah. That’s how rude and condescending these ‘people’ are. The absolute worst customer service for the absolute worst gaming product on the market, and they don’t give a 💩 because they basically have a monopoly. I hope there’s a (random, accidental, non-human started) fire (that no human being could be found legally culpable for and is ruled an “act of God”) at their office and M*y, S*m, and I***e are burnt alive in the most excruciating way imaginable, then go to hell to experience the best Satan has to offer for all eternity. Exceptionally cruel and soulless “people”, picking on autistic kids and not giving half a squirt of pee what happens to you, your account, your games, or your money. Truly the scum of the earth. Honestly can’t wait til I die so I can see them roast in the lake of sulphur and laugh, and ask them for their bank card information and shout “Oops wrong password! Try again”, that will be how I spend 100% of my time in heaven. I obviously do not condone any illegal actions against them, but really wouldn’t shed a tear if one day someone has enough of their abuse and takes matters into their own hands.",

The customer support is just straight up missing. I can't log into Steam on my phone because the password input field on their website doesn't work. It allows input of letters but not numbers, so I can only input part of the authentication codes needed to log in. Even weeks later, their email \"support\" hasn't even bothered to get back pretending like they're \"working on the issue\". They obviously just can't be bothered, and don't care. It makes me wonder if that's how they are with even bigger issues. At any rate, it's working fine on my PC and it's overall been a good service in my experience.",

After many hours of research and finding out what the problem actually was considering i hadn't even got on the game I thought that getting a refund would be easy. Steam however from somewhere has me playing the game for 12.5 hours and told me there would be no refund. So after looking at there support system which is rubbish just a bunch of FAQ's, nobody actually to go through anything with you or a phone number to ring or any real help. It doesn't end there either because there refund team just sends you a mail saying you aren't being refunded after a few hours doesn't even respond to my reply to that the support ticket is just closed.

It was, but there was no way to reply to the message. I had to start over with another request and explained that it was a follow up and I was fine with the refund/repurchase scenario. The response to this message was from a different representative and I was told I could not be refunded because the game had been played for 3 hours. Again, no way to respond to the message. There is absolutely no way that I’ve found to have any sort of back and forth conversation. Also, as others have mentioned, that captcha situation is ridiculous if you need to reset your password.

The reason provided for the suspension was an alleged attempt to gift items from my alternative account to my main account. However, I believe this action was unjustified and I kindly request a re-evaluation of the situation. I encountered an issue with gifting items and promptly opened a ticket to seek assistance. To my surprise, my account was banned shortly after by KAL from Valve. According to the ban notice, it was stated that my account was being used for commercial purposes, but I assure you that there is no evidence to support such a claim.I deeply value my experience as a member of the Steam community, and I have always adhered to the platform's terms of service and guidelines. I have never engaged in any activities that violate the terms or seek to exploit the system for personal gain. The intention behind gifting items from my alternative account to my main account was purely for personal convenience and not for any commercial purposes.I kindly request that you review the details of this case and reconsider the suspension of my account. I am confident that a thorough examination of the facts will demonstrate my commitment to maintaining a positive and fair gaming environment on Steam. I would greatly appreciate your support and prompt resolution of this matter.Please let me know if there are any additional steps or information required from my end to facilitate this re-evaluation process. I look forward to your response and the opportunity to continue enjoying the Steam platform without any unwarranted restrictions.Thank you for your attention and assistance.",

From now on I will only be using 3rd party sites for skin trading. Furthermore, I have been feeding these f****rs cash since 2017 and they treat me like this?",

By the time I decided that it will not work ( even though I have a 12 gen i7 and RTX4070ti) I just want to point out that when you download a game the time it takes to download is already counting as being played.  I noticed that when I downloaded MS FS .It already counted 2 hours even before I had even attempted to play.I am so glad that I rebought a game I already had for a minimal amount so I could find out how terrible this platform is with regards to assistance or god forbid a refund.  Can you imagine how upsetting it would be if I had actually bought a game at full price.   Please remove the Starwars Game Squadrons from my account is is useless to me anyway.  Again thank you so much for allowing me to experience the crappy attitude on your end with a cheap purchase and preventing me from making that mistake with a more expensive game.",

Only time steam closes your account is if you start abusing the refund system. Bought a Steam deck last week, they kept me informed of the order process and received it 5 days later. So take the negative reviews with a pinch of salt, a lot of entitled gamers who often abuse Steam’s system.",

Their Steam Authenticator is one of a kind and extremely easy to secure and protect your account.People reviewing about being scammed and having their accounts hacked have only themselves to blame due to ignorance of what they are doing. I myself, due to stupidity, have had my account hacked, back before any steam authenticator was setup and therefore can say that it has never been an issue since - my account was returned and restored with the help of customer support.There is no wonder Steam is the most popular gaming platform on PC due to having the biggest availability of games out of all gaming platforms. The store front is quite simple to use/find the games you love as well as the discovery queue to quickly browse games that are recommended to your gaming tastes.Can not recommend anything other for those wanting to start out on PC Gaming.",

BTW:  Verified per my email history from Steam that I had not reset my PW - apparently they decided it had expired and were forcing me to reset it.  Mega frustrating, since also their PC app never remembers your PW, even though you click the 'remember me' box.  Saved it in a memo note on my phone last time I had to reset it, so I know FOR CERTAIN that was my PW.  Zero way to communicate with them or offer feedback.

Steam had my account returned to me within 24 hours of noticing the account has been stolen (along with my email which I managed to reclaim instantly, thank God!) I posted a ticket 5 days ago to rockstar and they have completely ignored it thus far. I thought I'd contact steam to see if they can help. I had a reply within 3 hours from steam about a platform that isn't even theirs. Yet rockstar make you wait 1 week+ for help on their own platform. I will only purchase games through steam from now on as I believe they care about their community. All these stupid half assed platforms EA app, Ubisoft connect etc are all so irrelevant. They all make you launch their crappy mini apps when you launch steam games all desperate to stay valid. STEAM FOR LIFE, Love you steam support ❤️",

Como usuario que soy de Steam desde hace más de 10 años he visto como se ha ido convirtiendo en una plataforma de juegos de las más tóxicas que existen. La gente comentan en los foros con lenguaje vulgar y despectivo, con insultos y troleando a todos los que no piensan igual que ellos. Lo peor de todo es que los supuestos moderadores de Steam no hacen nada, tan solo se limitan a borrar mensajes que luego los usuarios vuelven a poner con más inquina aún. Steam se ha convertido en un patio de recreo donde cualquiera puede insultar, coaccionar y ser racista sin ningún tipo de sanción. Por ello no lo recomiendo a día de hoy hasta que no cambie su política de tolerancia contra los insultos y malos modales. Hay otras paltaformas de juegos que son menos tóxicas y que ofrecen los mismos servicios e incluso mejores dadas las actuales circustancias en Steam.A really toxic environment. As a Steam user for more than 10 years, I have seen how it has become one of the most toxic gaming platforms that exists. People comment on the forums with vulgar and derogatory language, with insults and trolling everyone who does not think the same as them. The worst of all is that the supposed Steam moderators do nothing, they only limit themselves to deleting messages that users then post again with even more animosity. Steam has become a playground where anyone can insult, coerce, and be racist without any penalty. For this reason, I do not recommend it today until it changes its tolerance policy against insults and bad manners. There are other gaming platforms that are less toxic and that offer the same services and even better given the current circumstances on Steam.",

I emailed asking for a refund with the explanation but have received a stock reply that they won't refund me as it's over 2 weeks. By law the product is FAULTY AND NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE so I am entitled to a refund. They have taken my son's birthday money for something he can't use but just do not care.

I messaged steam support and was given a generic response and told any further tickets would be closed and not responded to. This is not good customer service. There is no place to raise concerns about customer service through Steam itself, or the policy in which this entails. I understand putting settings in place for scammers and fraud, but restricting how people gift is counter-productive. The money was still money beforehand in most cases. I tried to get answers or get it fixed, only to be told they can't remove it when other customers have. Some of us don't want to/can't use our cards for multiple reasons.

            "body": "Originally the absolutely best game launcher and platform - being a customer for too many years to count. Easy and fast to use, shop and play from.Unfortunately the last half year, the development team doing updates to the Steam launcher must have stepped off the deep end and gotten lost.Now the launcher is the worst of all 6 game platform launched I have been using. Slow to start, annoyingly huge popup for \"waiting for network\" when everything is already connected fine, followed by getting the entire store thrown in your face each and every time you launch it. The perfect and 100% widely used \"launch minimized\" that ALL other launcher have is removed and gone. You can shortcut your way around it using -silent, but it will not remove the popup for erronious \"waiting for network\"Customer have been complaining for months - nothing has been done about it. As someone who programs, I know how damn easy it is to make an application minimize to the tray. So what is going on? developers lost touch with their customer base? Become too large to care? I do not know and I do not mind - its caused me to pause when chosing which platform to purchase from onwards.Luckily there are plenty and they are all waiting for Steam to falter and loose their grip anyway - but why are they helping the competition when they were ahead by a mile?...",

Yet when I make a customer service refund request, I never feel like my problems are answered or reviewed by an actual person. Just automated feeling answers that don't look at your explanations and intent of the return. If you've played more than 2 hours and had the game more than 2 weeks, you're out of luck no matter the reason.Over all, I'd like to know my explanation were read. Maybe this is how it will always be, but in this technology age I think companies should be able to keep up with customers and help come to a solution to keep them happy and wanting to come back for more.In the future I'll have to look somewhere else for my gaming wants and I recommend you do the same.

And then, how one can get their account stolen with Steam Guard protection and two-factor authentication active is honestly beyond me!!! Personally, I have 15 years of service, almost 2000 video games, and 2 Steam Decks, and on those rare occasions when I had problems, customer service was prompt in resolving them, sometimes even at their own expense (for example: recently, they sent me brand new chargers, a case, and a screen cleaning cloth for the Steam Deck, free of charge, which I had mistakenly sent to them with the device for RMA, and which had gotten lost. It was my fault!). The only thing I can say is that, over these years, I have always felt extremely satisfied with the treatment I have received. Thank you for your work!",

Imagine owning a legal car, having a valid license but being allowed to drive only if a cop sits next to you. That is Steam's version of DRM. Does this Gestapo protect  against piracy? No. There are pirated Steam games out there - but my comment is not about piracy, it is about the experience of using a legal copy. The games I play are in \"me vs AI\" format, I am happy with offline mode. But guess what? Even in offline mode it is compulsory to log on to your compulsory account, when the average game developer just gives me a code for my legal installer. ok I try to log on. The system hides my own password from myself, options like see the password when typing or copy-paste are just not available. After 1 day of using Steam I am fed up.",

WE MUST BEAT THEM AT THEIR OWN GAME AND GIVE THEM AS MUCH BAD REVIEWS AND REPUTATION AS POSSIBLE PLEASE HELP SHARE THIS INFORMATION ON HOW UNRELIABLE IT IS TO PLAY STEAM GAMES ON WINDOWS!WARNING TO THE FUTURE OF WINDOWS USERS WHO FIND THIS REVIEW PLEASE SWITCH TO LINUX BECAUSE MICROSOFT IS BECOMING MORE UNRELIABLE WITH THEIR COMMUNIST END OF LIFE POLICY! SORRY FOR ALL CAPS YOUR CONCERNS MATTER REGARDLESS!!!!The digital age gaming needs to be stopped and is effecting the gaming industry dramatically! With Microsoft having a bad reputation of their End of Life policy Steam is dictated into action to FORCE users to UPGRADE to a NEWER version of Windows when people will risk staying on their current version. If Steam wants to lose customers over forcing people to upgrade to newer versions of Windows this shows how mediocre it is to play games on Steam or even waste your hard earned cash on them if I were you guys I would either learn how to use Linux or I would go back to console gaming immediately if Steam doesn't want my money that bad I'm pausing on buying ANYTHING from Steam and wish I could get my money back on half the games I bought from them. Steam in regards of reliability is completely USELESS when you can use a disk console and keep your game for a lifetime and disks are also easily replaceable if damaged and it helps the gaming industry thrive the digital age gaming occult is gonna ruin video games. Either unresistant your communist upgrade policies or I'm done with being a hardcore Steam customer forget it I'm going back to console gaming anyone reading this comment if you want to continue gaming I highly suggest go back to consoles and keep your main computer for basic tasks apparently Valve doesn't want our money that bad enough! If you want to continue supporting Steam I'm not stopping you I would highly suggest get off Windows now and switch to Linux they got a longer End of Life policy than Windows does I highly recommend using Garuda which is open source and appears to have no End of Life policy and is open to any kind of projects. Also I am aware of Steams policy so don't give me that well you're the one who clicked I Agree when it CLAIMS steam is open source that's a lie because if it was open source why can't I still use Windows 7 in 2024?",

            "body": "I am writing regarding Steam's handling of a recent inquiry I made about their promotional strategies, particularly the emphasis on 'Black Gaming of the Month'. My experience with their customer service has raised serious concerns about their transparency and potential racial bias in their advertising choices.I initially contacted Steam to express my concerns over their seemingly exclusive focus on games related to Black history, while seemingly neglecting the contributions and narratives of other racial and cultural groups within the gaming community. This approach appeared to contradict the principles of diversity and inclusivity, which are vital in the gaming industry.However, my attempt to engage with Steam on this matter was met with a lack of substantive response. Instead of addressing my concerns directly, Steam suggested that I use their public forums to discuss this issue, a recommendation that I found inappropriate for an internal policy-related matter. Further efforts to seek clarification and a formal response from Steam were abruptly halted when they closed my support topic, without providing any satisfactory explanation or resolution. A practice they never do under other topic to the support group.This action, and the lack of transparent communication from Steam, has led me to believe that there might be an underlying unwillingness to acknowledge or address potential biases in their promotional strategies. The closure of the support topic, particularly without a proper resolution or acknowledgment of the issue raised, suggests a concerning level of disregard for customer feedback, especially on matters as significant as racial representation and inclusivity.I wanted to highlight Steam's apparent lack of transparency and possible racial bias in their promotional choices. It is crucial for consumers and the wider public to be aware of how companies handle sensitive issues related to racial representation and customer feedback.I hope that Steam reevaluates their communication and promotional strategies, ensuring they align with the values of inclusivity and diversity, and that they maintain a transparent and responsive dialogue with their customer base.",

I've had my public game reviews bombarded and mocked multiple times. I have tried to play nice for the first couple months and have made many reports.My reports have been ignored, brushed under the rug and every disciplinary action was taken out on me. I was banned 4 times from the steam forums. Understandably, my behavior has been unacceptable per time coming back from the bannings.However, that doesn't devalue the fact that EVERY single user is to be beholden under the rules of the Steam Forum and Community Guidelines. Why is it, am I the only one punished when there had been insurmountable evidence that shows other users picking at, belittling, berating, harassing, stalking and provoking me.Instead, my posts are removed and I'm painted as the problematic scapegoat in the community. Moderators and Steam Support have given me the cold shoulder, but they're right on me in seconds to issue bans and warnings.How is any of this fair? What is it telling when your support staff do not hold a neutral judgment on anything that happens in the community? That by not dealing with the troublesome users, you are rewarding and enabling them to continue to do as they like by having them jump on people they don't like when they post topics and threads of discussion in the forums.Moreso, allowing them to get away with instigating issues with other users who have otherwise contributed to the Steam Platform with game reviews.Again, how is any of this fair to punish and shelve one user when multiple users have committed similar faults? It isn't and I think the whole moderation staff need to undergo sensitivity training and refine their judgmental skills or just be let go entirely to find newer people who can do a fairer job that they couldn't.",

            "body": "Like other recent reviewers I have experienced poor customer service from Steam. I bought a DLC for a game I had previously bought but uninstalled. That meant when I downloaded the DLC I had to re-install the main game. This time when I played the main game it was so buggy that I could hardly progress my character because the game kept crashing. I couldn't access the DLC content because that relied on my character having reached a high level. Steam wouldn't refund the cost of the DLC because they claimed I had played the DLC for more than two hours - they had metered my playtime of the main game instead of playtime of the DLC which I never managed to experience. I now have a buggy version of the main game which is now virtually unplayable and wasn't bugged when I played the old version two years ago. The game developers have told me they can't fix (repair) the bugs so I am left with a faulty product which breaches my rights as a consumer. There is no direct email address for Steam Support and no option to place a general complaint about their poor support. I am now faced with shelling out for recorded delivery to send a formal complaint by surface mail to Steam's head office in my country. I'm not going to buy games from them in the future!",

I know this is done, because rtarded teenagers are stupid enough to press phising links etc. You truly need to sit down and rethink the entire system. It's so so bad.

I am not bowing to Steam's demands what OS I should be using to stay in touch with my purchases.Wait. This whole story reminds us that we don't own games here, we seem to 'rent' them until the platform finds a reason to lock them away from us if we don't obey.They could just leave a Steam client running especially for Win7 like forever, no? Win7 is 64bit just like Win10 (just better), so the excuse is rather weak, stating some Chrome browser (which I never use) can't run any longer on Win7, so bye-bye to you all.I advise everybody no longer to buy games on Steam and look for a DRM-free place, like GOG is. Unfortunately some games are Steam-exclusively \"sold\" (rented), in this case, pirated versions may be the last option - hey, you paid for them already, that is the best excuse ever to get yourself a copy which will run regardless.After all, I was not so wrong when I had my reservations about Steam back in the days...",

I absolutely f#$%$^*( hate that feature and the fact you cannot simply turn it off rubbish. Their 2 week refund policy is absolute dog sh%*t, my brother spent just over $900 on games when I was on vacation and they didn't give a sh*%t, just auto rejected my refund request, I didn't notice this till it was well beyond their joke of a 2 week policy for digital property, that can 100% not endure any form of wear n tear, hell clothing stores that sell physical property have better refund policies than these guys do, it's quite laughable, but greed makes this world spin, or does it??

I cannot since they removed the cd key section so I can't even look up which account is binded, I started a refund just so I could actually get a message across, they ignored the attactched message saying \"I don't actually want a refund I just need help finding my account\" and told me I can't refund it which I was never trying to do. Ai is not a good replacement for customer service considering the various issues it cannot resolve. A while ago I lost my steam account and that's when you could message them, so I got it back however if I lost it again I'm certain all my money spent and games would be lost.",

Waiting ages for customer support to reply and they do not even answer to the actual question, instead they told me that the chat I am having with them is not accesible by 3rd parties (????) while not replying to my question.

Pathetic customer support, much slower than what Steam shows in their stats and completely useless. I cannot even purchase any game or redeem any code just because I dared to purchase a Deck. I did not try to jump region lock or do any dodgy stuff, Steam just did not like the address I am living...Edit: customer support just refuses to reply to my question on what is considered an official document and keep replying \"we accept official document that includes the matching name and billing address used on this PayPal account\".

It is probably also worth noting that the customer service team closed my help request/conversation without consulting me on whether I was happy with the help provided or if I had anything else to discuss.

It is absolutely dog how they treat their consumers, not  everyone has a way of gifting something to someone this is the only way that it was possible. But yeah, boring robot replies and not a single care towards their customers and consumers, mine is a bit minor since this expires in 3 months, but 99% of the times steam support is useless.",

I ended up deleting it from my computer for storage. I happened to go online and see Steam offers refunds for games you played less than 2 hours of (which I did) and bought less than 2 weeks ago. I didn’t come across this information until recently, so by the time I put in my request it had been about 4 weeks. The policy states each request is reviewed on a case by case scenario, so I expected them to try to at least provide me an explanation if they were going to deny my request. What I got was an automated email with no details other than “you are outside of the time frame.” No explanation, not even some sort of communication or apology from a real person so I knew an actual human had considered my situation. I guess Steam just wants to continue funding a transphobic agenda. I will be buying all future PC games elsewhere from now on.",

You can get an amazing steal when a game goes on sale; I remember picking up the original Assassin's Creed for $7 or so a few months after it was released. I've had to change my password several times over the years because of me updating passwords for other things and getting everything mixed up but even that was never an issue, always able to quickly regain access to my account. If there are some performance issues for any games I purchase, I understand that it's an issue with porting, older games working on newer operating systems, and poor optimization with Steam's platform but so far I've only had such issues with Bayonetta and Fallout 3. Haven't tried playing those in a while but I heard there have been updates so fingers crossed. Overall though, have played countless hours and will play countless more (just got Red Dead Redemption 2 Ultimate Edition on sale).",

I had the game on the background and they counted that as play time while I had the Google on. They said I cant get a refund because they show play time of 4 hrs. I told them let me send you 5 min of game time and you can see you cant even play the game for 2 min yet along 4 hrs. I open a dispute with my cc and asked steam for the second time for a refund. I buy many games from them and today apart from resident evil i also bought tomb raider..never had an issue with any games from them until today. Shocking they do not want to refund a paying customer. I will be taking advise on moving to another paying platform. I unistalled and deleted the game and left reviews on steam on the issue, I'm not one to buy a game and request a refund if I dont like it. I want to play the game but it unplayable.

I came up with a way to make the protection more reliable overnight after I was scammed, but they release user security updates, if lucky, maybe once every few years. And even then, they deal with the consequences, not the root cause.As I understand it, they hire people off the street for customer support and pay them pennies because the Steam customer support doesn't give a damn about us.It seems logical that after someone scam your skins, and Steam bans the person who took them from you, they should return the skins to you, right? But no, Steam couldn't care less, even though you were deceived because Steam can't implement basic protection against trade scams.I'm sure it's all because a long time ago, people used to trade skins to another account, then contact customer support, and customer support would return the skins like this: they simply duplicated them, and they stayed with the person who supposedly 'stole them' and with you. But then they stopped doing that, and now they won't give you anything back, and they won't unban you no matter what, they just don't care. They might even ban you for frequently contacting customer support...",

It's such a dissapointment that this type of thing is overlooked and often ignored.What is the point of reporting suspicious activity if nothing will be done to protect those who have been affected.To many people keep getting this issue, and steam just doesn't do anything, they should implement a system where if an item is purchased for more than 100 times the cost then something is going on and put the sale on hold until resolved. Even holding the purchase for 2 days to let users report the issue should be enough and would make scammers being unable to steal money so blatantly. If amazon and other sites do it while the purchase is being made and reviewed, why can't they do it on their marketplace.I suggest you never leave money in your steam wallet or your card registered, your security is up to you, and you can report issues, but they wont help you in that.",

The game itself is produced by a British Company and it is an incredible piece of software.  However to run it on a PC you have to set up an account with this awful company based in LALA land.  Alarm bells should have rung when I looked into steam further but I wanted to make the purchase, under normal circumstances I would not entertain anything based in the US as I have had very bad experiences with US based companies. Steam/Valve have reinforced my concerns.  Having owned the Game for 4 days I have spent 3 of those  days with emails repeating the issue and ignorance from support.  They have failed to read and understand the points I have raised instead they have replied with technical ***p that they seem to feel the user should know.  Today the issue was resolved however the messages that the Steam Interface gives are ambiguous to say the least and support don't give a damn.  The system says the item is in the Library so when you look it is not,  now that is wrong,  I shouldn't have to spend hours and hours and days trying to navigate a clunky unfriendly system, likewise they should not ignore the points raised in favour of that 'round about explanation' and technical ***p.  Never again stay well away from this rubbish and Frontier please let's buy the Game from yourselves directly your games don't need a gimmick from the USA",

Steam is using GLS transport (company based in Netherlands) to deliver the Steam Deck. You can not change the carrier even if you want to pay.Last Friday, I recieved an email from Gls to tell me that they have deliver the parcel to my home. When I came back home 2 hours after the mail, I find nothing in the box. I spent my whole weekend to look for it among the neighbours or the shop. The seller told me that he did not see any delivery truck on this afternoon.I try to check with the messenger of Gls france that told me directly that it was not there problem and I should take the matter to Steam. I request a proof of Gls france that they deliver the parcel. No answer since five days on that question. Still waiting.Then I went to Steam as they choose for you the carrier. They said that open an investigation on the matter.They came back yesterday to told me that it was not their problem either... and that I should see with the carrier....They close the matter but they never check with the carrier for sure.Now I am trying to contact GLS headquarters in Netherlands but I did not get an answer.I guess I can kiss my steam deck good bye l. Even if I am payback, I am not sure that I want to go trough that experience again...Now you know. It is at your own risk...Regards,Mat",

            "body": "In the last few days, Amazon Gaming Services falsely banned tens of thousands of accounts for being bots, causing them to be flagged on Steam as having a ban on their account.  Most of the banned accounts were simply inactive:  people who had tried out a free to play game called \"Lost Ark\", played a few hours and then lost interest.Most of those banned, including myself, don't care about not being able to play Lost Ark.  The problem is that the ban is registered on their Steam Account, affecting their reputation and impacting on their ability to play other games.  One example is Rust, which blocks users who have had a ban applied to their account in the last 180 days.  There are also other games that check for accounts for bans for the purpose of applying trust ratings to players.  When the players are rated as \"un-trusted\" it leads to them being excluded by other players.While I completely support banning botters, cheats and disruptive players, I don't agree that it is ok to misrepresent over 10,000 players as cheaters, simply because they tried out a free to play game six months ago and didn't continue playing. Steam designed, implemented and own the platform on which this is happening.  Even though Amazon Gaming Services have indicated the mass banning was a mistake on their part, Steam have done absolutely nothing for the players that still are flagged as banned on Steam as a result.  Steam are basically acting in the same way a revenge porn site:  creating the means and the medium for publishers to post harmful and inaccurate information, but taking no responsibility and saying it's not their fault and doing nothing to remove the harmful content they have facilitated.",

I asked for a refund, explaining that the game appeared broken, but was denied this because its been more than two weeks since my purchase, usually Id say fair enough, its in their terms of service right? But when the game doesn't work? That's not cool. I had to go back and forth with Bethesda's customer service that finally told me what I had begun to suspected, I had in fact bought a bundle that didn't contain the base game, fair enough. I will just buy that so I can play then, but no. the steam store was adamant that I already owned the product after placing it in the basket and being told I cant buy it, I removed it tried again, over an over again and over again, until something must have snapped and I  was finally able to complete my purchase. And make the game work.What pisses me of is that instead of Steams support actually supporting the games they sell and simply telling me: Oh, You need to buy the base game. And that would be the end of it, they offer NO support! They refuse my refund request on the arbitrary grounds that it more than two weeks since I made my purchase even though I hadn't played the game and the game appeared to be broken. When they could just as easily helped me resolve the issue. But no. this is how they treat loyal customers, they cant even take the time to look at the issue and tell me that I'm missing the base game which I did gladly buy, but when I explain the situation and ask for help or a measly 10 dollar refund, all I get is a big F you! Sadly unclear marketing, and non existing customer support and quality control of the games in the  steam store is the new standard for Steam.Maybe someday a company that actually values their customer relationships will come along and make Steam obsolete.

Don't forget - just because you consentually work for them for free, doesn't mean you don't work for them and that your actions don't reflect on the company. At one point, they used the Steam forums' anti-swear filter to block out the words \"Kinguin\" and \"G2A\" - not to avoid inflammatory language but to try to keep people from learning about the existance of other companies - withholding of knowledge - just because the existance of those companies is financially inconvienient for them.I have spoken to members of Steam support before, and they talked to me just as immaturely as their global mods did. As much as Steam touts it's apparent \"professionality\" of the platform, they are anything but that. They are just playground bullies of the internet, and they like to monopolize PC gaming. They also have a bunch of laughably broken glitches in their system. Exploit them as much as you can I say. They love to scam people, and they deserve a taste of their own medicine.

This works but the answers are so vague as to be unusable. Recently, when I open Steam it started asking which account I want to  log into. AS I only have 1 this is basic. So I asked why did this change and how to prevent this extra step every time I open the program.  We are now 8 emails into it. These are the answers. 1.You changed your browser settings (no I did not).2. Change it in Settings (where specifically?)3. Under ask about account (under which of the 16 headings & numerous sub-headings is this found, specifically?)4. TBDSeriously, any normal intelligence human being could have said  that, possibly the browser settings changed, if not go to Settings>xxxxx>xxxxx> & click xxxxx. A 2 email, 3 minute fix.

I bought the game 2 times on both my accounts.Perfect - I thought!One day later I open Steam and get an alert message:----------------------------------------> This account may have been accessed by someone else.> Steam Support suspects your account may have been accessed by someone else. We are temporarily restricting modifications to this account as a security precaution. Please contact Steam Support so we can assist you.> > This account will have restricted functionality until the owner has regained access.> Purchasing, gifting, trading, cd-key activation, playing online on VAC enabled game servers, and Steam Community access have been disabled.----------------------------------------That this happened on BOTH my accounts!I quickly contacted the Steam support and got the following reply:----------------------------------------> In order to recover this account, we must verify your ownership of the original CD Key that was used to create this Steam account.----------------------------------------I am one of the oldest customers this company has. I created my Steam account in 2003 when Counter-Strike 1.6 was first made available. To register it, Half-Life 1 keys from 1998 were required.This means:- The CD key was from 1998 => 25 years ago.- The CD key was registered 20 years ago with SteamBoth CD and key were then absolutely useless/worthless and not required anymore for any reason whatsoever. The key could not be registered with another Steam account and the game could only be downloaded via Steam. Why should I keep 2 useless and worthless pieces of plastic/paper for another 20 years?Steam doesn't care at all that everything ever associated with the account (e-mail addresses, payments etc.) has my name on it. They wouldn't even accept my ID/passport as proof. I proactively suggested alternative means of proof, but they simply ignored it.The Steam support keeps on repeating that the one and only possibility for me to have my account recovered is to provide this specific (CD key from 1998) proof.This whole issue is absolutely absurd on so many levels and probably also illegal!It was easier to get a copy of my birth certificate in Germany than to recover my Steam account... Just think about that...CONCLUSION:They take my money for the games, then they restrict my account and leave me hanging.Great job, Steam...P.S.:I think that the customer support system is completely run my AI, because- my questions are not getting answered,- the responses I get are always the same text blocks and- I only can give 2 answers inside the ticket until they just close it (because - you know - I failed to comply with their ultimatum about the 25 year old CD key).",

Don’t buy games on here unless you’re absolutely certain it is a good game. Don’t read reviews from pro/expert gamers as they’re quite often individuals who spend way too much time in front of a screen. Get reviews from average users to make sure the game is accessible for people with lives outside of gaming.",

I recently bought one of my favorite games remastered and got about 18 hours into the game and upon a steam update, my save files all went corrupt. I have tried 4 different methods and spent a fraction of the hours playing to try and repair the files, or research how to back them up.Most fingers point to steams abysmal cloud storage system for their issues and have found fixes, but none of them have worked in my situation, so now I’ve spent hours trying to contact them or get a refund. They are impossible to contact, and try to point the finger at square Enix, even though it’s clearly their file storage system failing, and when I request a refund, it’s promptly refused without human review because I have played over 2 hours.My game is unplayable at this point, because who wants to play another 18 hours over to have to potentially restart, and to even test whether it will even save, I would have to run through the whole beginning sequence and waste my time if it doesn’t.So beyond frustrated with all my time wasted.Edit: Square enix itself got back to me almost immediately to my complete and utter disbelief. They were quick to help, and provided a list of file locations to check and relay the information back to them so they could diagnose and fix my issue. This unfortunately wasn’t my first rodeo with Steam, so I thanked Square Enix and let them know I would simply repurchase CC on the Switch as I’ve decided to leave steam permanently. The fact that a company who’s reputation is that large took ample time to reply multiple times and fast made it clear that I no longer wish to support steam, and will happily spend that money to support a company that actually cares.",

While Steam /Valve Corporation certainly have the First Amendment right to sell a game of this nature, others have the First Amendment right to complain about it.The trailer (on Steam's web site) includes the terrorist feeding an Israeli soldier to a shark, killing another one with a chain saw, execution-style shooting of a downed Israeli, and a suicide bombing. (The game does not, however, feature violence against Israeli civilians.)In addition, some of the reviews of the game contain openly anti-Semitic content like \"Let me tell you that as much as the next sane and noble guy I hate the international banker and media manipulating tribe,\" \"Hell yeah, I love anti-semitism too,\" and \"Anyone mad over the publishing of this game is just a victim of the propaganda perpetuated by the small hat people.\" (small hat = yarmulkes?) While I do not know if Steam moderates these reviews, the nature of these reviews reflects on the game itself.I have also informed Steam of this issue directly.",

I've had a few games that are buggy or downright unplayable, but they don't issue refunds. Like others have said they state different reasons for not issuing it, and this leads me to believe they don't intend to give refunds whether the game works right or not. WWE2K22 is the latest example. The game seems good but I've had it crash quite often on me, a bunch of times during matches in story mode, and a few times while creating wrestlers. Being in the middle of creating only to have it crash and lose everything is mind-numbing and infuriating. I've learned to save it occasionally. How do these games get released being so unstable? No wonder it was discounted. I've had a few experiences with a bad game and no refund and I was already on the fence about using Steam. I've skipped throughout the years with Smackdown vs Raw. This is my first recent purchase of a WWE game since SD vs Raw 2010. I'll stick to the oldies but goodies, and I'll look elsewhere to purchase games because I've been with Steam for years buying on occasion, but they don't want my business",

            "body": "Admittedly, Steam customer service is appalling. Let us look at Valve/Steam’s business model. We have an online merchant (storefront) selling and streaming games on their ‘distribution’ platform. The breadth and depth of their customer and technical support does not extend beyond referring customers to the software developer or other Steam customers (forum).  Very shrewd business operation would you agree? This allows Valve/Steam to maintain low overhead while assuming no responsibility for post-sales support. In effect, Valve/Steam is a third-party company that sells software as-is and processes credit card transactions. Billing is efficient and instantaneous while refunds are equivalent to a rigged card game where the dealer always prevails.  In addition, responses are canned and fail to address the specific issue. For example, customer purchased Street Fighter V. Game did not have sound when connected to a large screen HDTV. Other games tested on Valve/Steam distribution platform functioned normally. In fact, Street Fighter IV functions as designed. Customer reached out to Steam and received a canned response to contact Capcom. Contacted Capcom and received no response. Posted the issue in the Steam forums and received no response.  Frustrated, contacted Steam to request a refund and was immediately denied. Not a word regarding my technical issue, only referring to the time-usage policy. The more humorous aspect of this is the rabid responses received when posting this experience within the Steam forum. One would suspect that the Steam protectors were dispatched in full force to stifle any critics of this glorified software vender. Not withstanding the sunk cost, it was entertaining to see the myriad responses when “charge back” was voiced.  Couldn’t obtain a single response initially but the careful use of these two blasphemous words garnered immediate attention. Why? Admittedly, the hard-hitting responses were expected as a charge back is the only way the customer can retain some type of control of his/her financial transaction (investment). With a claimed customer base of 27M users, we are not dealing with Ph.D.’s. In the present case, outside of the repeated mimicking of the return policy, there was absolutely no comprehension of the issue, time wasted, and money lost.  The highlight of the forum exchange was a satirical response from a dimwit posting a link to an obscure third-party website that purported to address the glitch with SFV.  Although, Valve/Steam, Capcom, and the Forum soldiers were unable/unwilling to provide any initial assistance, customers are expected to be aware of an obscure website. Shame on the customer for failing to find one website out of the 1.2B websites on the Internet! The key takeaways from this frustrating and oddly entertaining experience are numerous. Purchase software at your own risk, software is sold ‘as is’, return policy supersedes all situations, Steam provides no technical support, technical support is the responsibility of the software developer, and the software developer has no obligation to provide technical support. In other words, do not waste your time trying to engage customer service, software developer, or the kids in the forum. Request a refund immediately and move on. Valve/Steam is NOT in the business of issuing returns and thus, do not allow yourself to be bullied. The intent of Valve/Steam is to evade the customer so that he/she writes-off their losses and moves on. Most importantly, as Kryptonite weakens Superman, the charge-back weakens Steam. Do not be afraid to use this and be prepared to engage the Steam mob if mentioning this in the forums (sandbox).  From a consumer protection perspective, it is believed that Valve/Steam does have a level of responsibility to address/resolve customer concerns. The link between Valve/Steam and the developer is intentionally ambiguous. Neither want to increase headcount and manage post-sales support as it does not provide the short-term revenue as does processing credit card transactions. This is one of the reasons why pirating of software persists. Why spend/lose $40 on SFV and deal with these headaches when it can be obtained for free? Based on the sheer volume of complaints, the consumer must leverage the charge-back process when appropriate and until Valve/Steam makes the necessary improvements. Incidentally, do not be surprised to read about a forthcoming class action lawsuit.",

            "body": "Steam is a terrible company. Band of thieves would be a better description of them. Example, they refuse to give refunds for games that don't work, they sell old games that are incomplete, missing files, video, and sound. The steam client running in the background is a data hog.The perfect example is the recent Sims 4 debacle. After the most recent Sims 4 update the game became unplayable for millions of players. (I know that is not steams fault, but I'm getting to it.) This Sims 4 update also added things to the game that myself and many other players didn't want and EA announced that these were not optional and could not be turned off. After seeing all this I went into steam and turned off updates for the Sims 4, so it didn't break my game. But now the game will not launch with out the update, but if you install the update you cant play the game. Now, back to the EVIL steam. So I now have a game that I payed over $50 dollars for, that I can not play. Will steam give me a refund. No of course they wont. All they care about is that I played the game more than 2 hours. Their customer support for refunds is a bot that checks the title of the game and play time, if it's over 2 hours, or has been more than 2 weeks. No refund. I sent no less than 40 request for a refund explaining all the different reasons that the game was suddenly made unplayable. Same auto generated reply everytime, from a non replyable email. steam is a worthless company with over priced games, and predatory practices, and on top of all that, keep in mind that when you \"BUY\" a game from steam, you don't own it. If you uninstall steam, none of \"your\" games will work, as a matter of fact if you don't think ahead and move them, uninstalling steam also uninstalls all of \"your\" games.steam is EVIL, they should be shut down and have to refunded every penny they have stolen from customers. Do the world a favor and DO NOT use steam, buy a physical copy of the game. Developers that don't release physical copies will start releasing them when people stop falling for this predatory practice of \"SELLING\" you games that you don't own",

I had to do a partial chargeback for only the difference of what I paid and the discounted price from the sale.  Steam then restricted my access so I cannot play the game, and they want me to pay full price to unrestrict it, therefore they have committed theft of what I have spent on the game of $35.99 an they want $59.99 more.  They also restricted me from purchasing new games.I am considering a chargeback on the remaining $35.99 but if steam does not lift the account restrictions entirely I have no choice but to never use them again.   I will also consider legal action.  It makes things worse that there is no phone number to call to try to resolve issues over the phone.I have over 300 games on my steam account, I have over $3000 invested into it.

Yes i haven't made a purchase for a year but i shouldnt have to, i just want to sell my cards that i recieved from the games I HAVE purchased in the past or from games that i have been gifted.maybe if i was able to sell some cards i could actually make a purchase. All those 373 games in my account that i have purchased in the past and they do me like this.This is just so wrong in my opinion, steam turning into a scummy company.Friends from another country used to be able to gift you games but cant do that anymore, steam used to be great but its not anymore.Really considering selling my steam account and going elsewhere. I just do not like what steam has become and the way its going.",

I also found out this isn't the first time this has happened, first time was back in 2015.After searching many forums (paradox, CO, steam, and others) I found this topic extensively talked about. I even contacted paradox. Everything has lead to the problem being a steam client issue. I went through the difficulty of contacting their support (like many companies these days, no support just forums). I finally figured out how to email them, and did, inquiring if they are planning to fix the issue.When I got the email back. I was told to look through the forums to see if the situation has been discussed at all. I responded by informing them that that is how I found out about the issue in the first place, etc. I got a response back saying they were closing the ticket.0 stars should be an option, as are they not only losing money, but causing other business to lose money.

Steam did nothing, because they don't care about crimes. To avoid this happening a second time, he even got rid of the API key, which we though was the problem. So he traded again, this time with me and again someone hacked into his trade and the knife (70 Euro) is gone. Let this be a lesson to all steam users. Don't buy CSGO items and don't give those people your money, they wont care at all, if U loose those skins. Its just a waste of money. Thx Valve for being this kind of a business.

There's a lot of great innovations too.The reason I'm writing this is because I wanted to make sure a PC in a different location was downloading a particular game, and I could do it so easily from my Steam installation where I am. I imagine the amount of negative reviews Steam has here is down to the usual motivations (a bad experience will prompt you to write a review, but a if you have good experience you'll just get on with it and play a game).",

He suggested that I buy a cheap game through them and see how it goes. He did not want to influence me one way or the other. So I bought a game discounted to under £5. I'm glad that I did. It came with an invalid key. Steam blamed the seller, the seller told me to stuff it and Steam were about as useful as a chocolate ashtray. They suggested that I speak with the developers and the developers, understandably have shrugged their shoulders. So I lost under a fiver. So glad I did not fall for the crap and paid serious money from these cowboys. My only sense of achievement in this whole sorry affair is that I have managed to put at least six people off from having anything to do with these people. Four family members and two friends. I am just so lucky that I did not fork out serious money.",

After that time, it was quite clear this game wasn't for me and I asked for a refund.I explained that in my ticket, yet just received a generic response that my playtime was over 2 hours therefore no refund.After finding a different way to request a refund (hoping to at least obtain an actual response), I was once again met with a generic response, +2 hours no refund.Just to make this clear: my problem is not about being denied the refund itself (although it seems clear that I should, as there is no way to actually play the game without waiting 4+ hours queue).The real problem, is that I'm still not sure a single person even read one of my requests, as all the responses I received were copy-pasted automatic responses.This is not customer service, it is automated dismissal.",

In the end I gave up on the game and wanted a refund to buy a working game. Steam refused because I played for more then 2 hours. In my response why I am asking refund I clearly stated errors, named them and explained crashes and issues with the game that game looks like Alpha pre-release version and not a full game as Steam and developers of the game are advertising their game, and it is not a cheap game, 40 EUR. Years ago Steam already did once that to me, where I bought a game which was not working and after trying to fix the game and monitor behaviour for 2-3 days I quit in the end trying to find a workable solution and asked for a refund so I could buy a game that works. They also refused.They are scammers, and based on EU laws their activity toward customers is criminal, they sell non-functional games for a price of AAA full working titles and as such they also advertise their none working products as functional ones. There are several law issues here where Steam together with some developers is breaking the law intentionally which has the bad outcome for customers because they end up being damaged financially by Steam, like in my case. In other word, what Steam is doing is criminal activity called fraud.Now I ended up with game that does not work and without a money. Great business, corruption pays the best. Would not recommend others to use this platform to purchase games. They are scammers.",

Nothing can make your community stay postive, that will hurt steam more.Also, hiding a forum staff's name so we don't catch them deleting evidence  for spoliation and share half to prejudice me and anyone else is wrong. Preventing a person for viewing his evidence in steam support \"only staffs can see\" is also wrong.Making new rules to create more silence brings negativity to your community and could be less useful for people to prevent posting on the forums! How are you going to make them feel welcome by doing those stuff?Anyway, steam is just a dying platform. I am no longer investing my money into it. I will keep check of my bank account and hopefully nothing gets taken out. Also i am transferring to GOG because it is an european platform. Much respect for those guys.

            "body": "Be very careful of the games you buy on Steam. They have a 14 day rule in that if you buy a game and it will not work on your computer they will then just keep your money.  Even if the specs on your computer match the game. Also if you play the game for more than 2 hours and it develops problems you can not solve. Steam will also keep your money.  Their response is a auto message simple saying no refund.  It does not matter how good a customer you are the response is still the same. I have 35 games  and usually buy a number of games in the sale. There is no way to  check all these games in a 14 day time frame. Recently I tried to load one of these games and it did not work. Steam response was to simple keep my money because of the 14 day rule. Game platform has been find and games on the sale  have been good value. However to  keep money when a product does not work for a good  customer is why  I have to give such a poor rating. Also I advise only buy a game if you have time to check it out first for bugs and problems. You can do this online. If any problems show up in the first hour request a refund right away. Remember the14 day rule check your game out as soon as you buy it. I will certainly not buy a number of games at the sametime because you do not have the time to check each one out. Keep it to one game at a time.",

Which isn't a great thing as if anything goes wrong steam can just destroy your account and all your games are tied to that one account. You can easily lose $100s if not $1,000s of dollars when it comes to a steam account alone. Figure it's usually best to diversify so I decided not to invest any more time or money into one steam account.  I was coming up on 9 years with steam and was encountering too many problems and had to just let go at that point when it came to steam (I left steam or the steam platform at that point). I should say also that I'm kind of out of gaming for now though to as well so it was more or so a neutral decision as well. The fact that it's all tied to one account though is why I can't ever waste my time on steam again as a gamer. Had a problem with 1 game in my 9 years or so and never had any vac bans myself, but it's a complete waste of time to keep my account. The problem is I don't want to risk money in something when something could happen in the long run (close call with 1 game alone). Cut my losses now since again it's a platform monopoly to me personally (not easy to diversify - may not be a legal platform monopoly though - can't go anywhere else though) to me even if that's just personally.",

YOU CAN VIEW UK DIGITAL GOODS LAW ON THE GOV UK WEBSITE UNFORTUNATELY IM UNABLE TO POST THE LINK HEREI have been to the ombudsman who have agreed that they are in breech of this but valve is one of the companies who refuse to cooperate with them leaving me in a difficult situation.I have decided as f today to go through the small claims court as im in the lucky position i can afford a solicitor. We are hopeful to set a precedent so others will not have a similar issue as i have read many times the have. Just to note valve have recently lost a big case similar to this in australia and lost a case in france in relation to re selling games.Its time we stood up to large companies bullying customers that cant afford to have their rights respected.

My brief reading of the 1 star reviews, seems about 1/3rd are people who had their accounts hacked and are simply blaming steam for it. The one thing I think steam could do better, is managing the predatory actions that comes from being number one. Steam manages adequately at responding to these threats and has some wonderfully powerful utility built in to help combat them. However, the problem with predators is they target the weakest, and these tools need to be properly utilized in order to work. I would like to see a more pro-active campaign to stifle some of the most egregious scammers on the platform. Also a stronger and clear explanation of it's safety protocols.

Examples include Payday the heist and natural selection.As a side note:Game bans are also non appeal-able. Have you used game exploits  which everyone in the game can do and got banned by some random indie dev or just simply annoyed someone from staff off? Well enjoy a big fat red game ban across your steam profile showing everyone that you're a very naughty boy. *However if you are a hacker who uses aim bots to win games go screw yourself.*",

            "body": "I have been using Steam for about 15 months now and have accumulated almost 100 games in that time. Take the bad reviews on here with a grain of salt as most of the complaints that I read seem to be from user error. PROS: 1. Steam have a great \"No questions asked\" refund system that if you buy a game and don't like it, you can get the full refund as long as you haven't played the game for more than 2 hours. This has saved me a lot of money in the past and I can purchase any game in confidence knowing that if it doesn't hit my happy button, I can simply get a refund. The process for this is super quick too (as in under 20 mins), using their online tool directly through the platform.  2. The new interface as it is more visual and engaging. 3. I have a tower at home and a laptop for when I am on the go and I can stream through either device and the saves are automatic! 4. Wishlist the games that you like, Steam will always flick you a notification when they go on sale. It's a great way to save money and enjoy more of the games that you love. CONS (mainly about the interface): 1. This is not really Steam's fault (although they could strike up a deal with the developers) but some games force you to sign up to another platform (like Origin for Star Wars Fallen Order) in order to play. While the game saves and appears in steam, every time I want to play that game, I have to open up Origin and play it through there. Once you accumulate enough games, you end up having too many different platforms open all at once just to play your favourite games. Steam should try to work with the developers so that you can open the game up directly through Steam. Steam could show the developers logo, or maybe ask the gamer for permission, or show a banner that says that the game is made by the developer each time you play the game, something to promote the developer but allowing the game to launch through steam would be way better than opening multiple other programs just to play the games. I buy the games through Steam, so I should be able to play the games through Steam. I shouldn't have to open/download and sign up to other platforms to play it (that's like ordering food from MacDonalds but having to pick it up at Hungry Jacks). 2. Sometimes during searches in the store page, clicking on a game, checking it out, and then deciding to return back to the store page, pressing the back button takes me back to the beginning of the store page. This means that I have to scroll allllllll the way back down to where I was to continue shopping. This is tedious and annoying and it would be great for Steam to remember where I last was browsing and so when I go back to the store page, it takes me right back to where I was. 3. There is no option to open up a game on the store page in a new window. Very frustrating for people that like organisation. When I get onto the store page and start scrolling down, it would be great to highlight/select/open up all the games that catch my eye and then go through them all, one by one, to decide which ones I want to \"Wishlist,\" which ones that I want to buy and which ones I don't want. Having to open one game at a time and then after my decision of that game, I have to return back to the store page, only to be reloaded and sent to the very top of the page. This means that I have to scroll alllll the way down again to where I was last in order to try and refind my place, and this is annoying and a waste of time!  4. Have more than 4 pictures per game on the store page, or maybe replace the images with actual gameplay. I am a visual person who likes to see what the gameplay looks like. Most of the time when I see a game that I like, I click on it and the first thing I am shown is the game trailer, understandably. Usually, most trailers don't show a lot of actual gameplay. This means that I end up leaving Steam and jumping onto YouTube to find some actual gameplay. This is time consuming, tedious and probably is a loss of sales on your end. Having instant gameplay appear when I hover my mouse over a potential game would definitely entice me to want to see more, which could lead to more sales for you. 5. You should come up with your own Humble Bundle style monthly subscription program where subscribers can pay a couple of bucks a month and get a few games as a bundle. I sign up to Humble Bundle for their monthly games and always end up loading them into steam anyway. Your marketing team should be way ahead of the game here dominating this space since all the games purchased through Humble, all get loaded onto your platform anyway. I would support it. 6. Your customer service is not great, the reviewers are clear about this. Perhaps a little extra training or if you were to pull off step number 5 above, you could use that money to invest into more customer service staff tuning these irritate reviews into positive ones. This and a few more ideas I have up my sleeve could see you dominating this space within the next 12-24 months, easily. Naturally, these are suggestions from my personal opinion and so I don't expect miracles (as based on the negative reviews on here, you have enough #!@$% to deal with, if you are even dealing with them), so I won't hold my breath for your response but when you next decide to throw us an update, these changes would be a lovely addition. Think about it.  Thanks and keep up the pretty good 'but needs attention' work!",

Steam just allows developers to do illegal things to their games, like barring paying customers from accessing them ala Doom Eternal's 1.1 update. Steam support actively argued against consumer law to the point I had to get consumer affairs involved to force them to abide by the law. The one voluntary star is for at least managing to keep the servers on most of the time.If I could go back in time I would boycott steam and use gog instead. This is a terrible, toxic platform run by money hungry borderline criminals who have the utmost contempt for you. Avoid.",

I visited Steam's website and attempted to purchase this game, but got a pop up message saying I already owned the game. But when I checked my library, it wasn't showing.  So I explained that it wasn't there and tried to buy it again.  Once more the same message appeared saying I already owned it. So I decided to load funds in my \"wallet\" in case I wanted any more games. Later I get an email saying I had purchased a new game and the funds  had been taken from my wallet.  I wrote to STEAM and asked how they figured they could charge me for a game I already owned? They replied that I had two hours of play time on the game so I couldn't get a refund.I replied that since I owned the game, of course there were hours of game time.  They ignored me and refused to refund the money. I applied to PayPal which I had used for game purchases and they said that STEAM stated there were no duplicate purchases in their records.  Is it my fault they don't keep records from two years ago? Well, I do. And I will never buy another game from STEAM.   I use two other gaming companies and have never had a problem go unresolved. The very least STEAM could do is issue a credit or a refund!",

I wanted to give 1 star as the cons of Steam is that inconvenient to me, but I'm giving them 2 because I do enjoy the community and workshops for games that support it. So what makes it so bad in my opinion? The horrendous customer service and how stupidly difficult it is to get any actual help, the system they use makes it hard to find answers to even basic questions but also makes it nearly impossible to intuitively send a help ticket-- which in 2020 is something you expect from even the lowest budget sites and service, let alone a giant like Steam. Frequent errors while purchasing games, the client crashing or just processing for an eternity before it failing-- getting an error message that you've attempted to buy too many games in the last few hours (when you've had 2 unsuccessful attempts) and getting a time out. They don't specify how many games to get a time out or how long it lasts, I've heard 10 games and 1 hour-- but gotten time outs with as little as 2 and for longer than 1 hour. Them blaming it on services like PayPal when PayPal hasn't been loaded at all and no money has been withdrawn by them, etc. No support when there is something wrong with a game or a company ripped you off, having to send evidence is expected-- but you can't actually add anything to the message so how exactly are you supposed to do that (messaging them to ask how leads nowhere naturally)? The positives are that with so many users there are a lot of people creating things for the workshops which is nice, and there are some good sales and indie games. When it works it works pretty well too, but really that's nothing to brag about as that's what it's supposed to do. I'd recommend finding somewhere else to buy games if you can, for us who already have a large library of games we're stuck but for new customers-- run.",

I know I'm probably not their target audience but I think that even a 'Netflix' or 'PlayStation Store' shop front style site would be more user friendly.I would have given it 1 star but I recently got the price of an unplayabel game refunded and that process was pretty straightforward. However, it may be worth noting I once bought a game that wouldn't load the final stage or the end cut scene (Life is Strange - maybe?) and Steam wouldn't refund because I'd played more than 80%. That policy didn't make much sense. It's a bit like paying full price for a book when someone's ripped out the final chapter.",

Even if this software is running only in order to download additional content it will count as play time. So as was the case with Elder Scrolls Online the game downloaded from Steam, the launcher was started and ran for several hours updating and patching the game. The game then crashed on every start. But even though there had been zero play time Steam would not refund an unplayable game as they system showed 4 hours of play time. Steam need to develop a process by which they can see play time rather than 3rd party launcher run time, otherwise the refund policy is potentially meaningless",

When installing a newer box some DLC wouldn't install despite being in my Library.  The failing DLC has the same support and requirements as other DLC that didn't have an issue on either box.Steam \"Support\" answers:1.  That product isn't available for [the platform that didn't have any issues].  Evidently they didn't understand what those little OS icons on the Steam Store pages are for.  Or, more likely given the following answers, didn't bother to look.2.  The DLC is progress locked.  Evidently they missed the part where I've already played all of the game and all of the DLC.  Or the part where the game refused to load a save, instead stating that the required DLC was not installed.3.  The inability of the Steam client to install content on a new box that it has already installed successfully on an old box is the fault of the content creator.  Evidently they missed (again) the part where the delta between success and failure is not the game content.  Or the part where their own purchase tracking indicates the content ready to install automatically but their client refuses to do so.4.  The DLC is in your Library, therefore it's installed.  Evidently they don't understand the Steam provisioning architecture or the difference between a list of accessible content in the cloud and the parts of that content that have been installed by the Steam client on a Customer's local box.5.  The base product isn't available for Linux, but is only available for Windows.  Evidently they're not aware of that little Steam product called \"Proton\", or that the base product is on Steam's own gold-level list of Proton supported games.",

            "body": "So a few days ago I tried to purchase a bundle before the fall sale ended, but ran into issues as I could not get the bundle to add to my cart it would only offer the purchase as a gift option.  I was trying to buy the counterstrike bundle but it would not add as I already have the free version of csgo in my library. At first I thought this was some sort of glitch on my mobile app so I restarted the app still nothing I attempted to figure out how to remove the free version as I thought maybe that was the issue but was unable to figure it out how to on the app. I've had demos of other titles before or other free versions and have not needed to remove them in order to upgrade to the full game or purchase the full game so naturally being that these are valve products  and steam is a valve owned company youd expect them to have it worked out so people don't run into these  issues, and to ice the cake without removing the free version I can add csgo to my cart and proceed to check out without receiving the product already owned or in library notification on the cart screen. Yet when I try to add the bundle i can't because it claims csgo is in my library. I mean yes I could have just bought the game by itself as it would add to the cart but when csgo was on sale for $8.47 and the bundle of all 3 counterstrike games was on sale for $8.29 it seems kind of illogical to pay more for less. All this said I sent in a ticket sharing my frustration and questioning how this issue was occurring well expressing my confusion that it will let me add the game but not the bundle,  and after waiting a day and a half received responce that basically says sorry there's nothing we can do for you, more a less it's not in steams policy to offer customers anything for having a bad experience with there service followed by the instructions on how to remove the free game from my library and the recommendation that I put the game on my wishlist and wait and see if it goes on sale followed by a shameless plug for there weekly sales and daily specials. Here's a company that makes billions in revenue annually from people like myself who regularly spend on games, and then as a customer you reach out in frustration over a bad experience caused by issues with their store and they respond with sorry for the inconvenience,  its not our policy to offer items at discounts before or after sales, so if you want the game your going to have to buy it at full price or wait, but in the mean time be sure to check our specials section for more great deals.... Great policy tell an upset customer who spends money every week on products that the only help you can provide is the advise to look at the other products that can be bought... Never in my life have I had a support representative try to sell me products when I'm complaining about a problem I had with their service while trying to purchase a product. I didn't request the game for free or at a discount for my trouble, but did expect that they would make some sort of gesture. I sent in the ticket questioning why I was experiencing the issue to begin with and why I can add the game to my cart but not the bundle this was never answered instead I received steams policy on offering discounts outside of sales and steams sale Schule like it's not advertised enough everytime I open steam weekly deals deal of the day. None the less as this is drawing out a bit long I'll end off with this after receiving the response I was less than satisfied and responded again in dissatisfaction and will have to wait another day and a half to see if I get another response and weather or not it will yelid any different results, I will 're write or post a new review if steam manages to show some better customer service support but as it stands now steam don't care about individual  customers they make more than enough to survive if they loose a few customers so they don't go out of the way and try to give you a reason to continue using their services if you've had a issue they shrug it off. In contrast I messaged amazon a week ago after receiving 2 different shipping estimates when I placed an order.  I just wanted to know which one was correct so I'd be home when it arrived,  they clearly explained how their shipping system works let me know which estimate was the correct one and went above and beyond in apologizing for my confusion and credited my account a free month of prime which was worth more than the item I had purchased to begin with. Some company's care about their customers others only care about money I'll let you decide what type of company steam is.",

Now it’s still in the Netherlands and was dispatched on the 5th December. Nobody at Steam seems to want to help. It’s hard trying to get them to understand that if you put a lot of money down for an Xmas gift that you can’t just go out and spend even more money to replace a gift that they can’t seem to deliver. They blame strikes but that didn’t seem to stop the docking station from being delivered. They’re expecting us to wait another 6 days until we can launch an investigation and try and get a refund. Terrible service. Download refunds:I brought call of duty modern warfare 2 from their store recently. The game played well to begin with but then the game got updated which made the game unplayable. The problem here is that the refund policy only covers you for the first two hours of play and beyond that you can’t claim any compensation or refund if the game because unusable beyond this point.  Games get updated a lot and it only takes a tweak of the game or the driver then the game because a pain to run. The download refund policy should also include updates. With the steam deck and the downloads being a problem it not only damages confidence in using steam but also means I have to sort solutions to these problems. Hopefully because we paid through PayPal we’ll hopefully get something back.  I feel sorry to PC gamers…apparently steam is the best place to get software for PC…if this is the quality of service of gamers have to experience you can understand why they get a bit shirty with console gaming. If you Google steam deck deliveries loads seem to go missing. The refund policy is a bit pants. Such a disappointment. I also feel sorry for steam because these issues impacts people wanting to use the service and will ultimately impact the money they bring in.",

I've been using Steam fine for at least a decade. Steam's Guards 2-step mobile verification never alerted me of anyone else logging into my account, which is supposed to happen. I felt falsely safe. Trying to communicate w/ Support to help, was almost non existent, extremely slow and very non remorseful about the situation, even making up new terms for someone hacking into my account and pretty much blaming me, the victim. I found our Steam is an unreliable and untrustworthy game client. A giant at it, I love gaming and their games for sure, but I can't trust the company anymore with my information anymore, because when I did and and something horrible happened, they support either flat out ignored my pleas for help or gave me some already prewritten script after the fact of what to say to make them seem like it wasn't their fault. You can not call nor can you email them. You're pretty much at their beckoning whim to respond, even if someone's password blocked you from your own account and is using your credit card to download skins and games for themselves for their other account. Before I uninstalled the game client, I looked up the hacker, with a clear record of it was and Steam had no punishment for it. I looked at some of the trade market items for sale and some still say my name for gifted items I tried to gift my son . I really don't know what to say, besides, invest, pay and play at this gaming client at your own risk.  Waiting for days for a response as someone steals your identity, from a gaming client of millions, is pretty horrid. I've dealt with Xbox, PlayStation, Blizzard with little mishaps and have always been at least satisfied and understand the out come. They have unfortunately lost a very dedicated fan and also the family of future gamers I've been raising. I can't even image how devastating something like this would be for a child or young adult, so I'm going to spare them from that and switch to more reliable gaming clients.",

They can sell you a game for 70$ that stops work correctly after two hours of gaming, making you believe that you will be able to get a refund anyway, but they won't refund you. They prefer to pocket the money they have stolen from you rather than keep a customer. Goodbye Steal. I will keep the games I downloaded until now (at least the working ones) and I will never buy anything on Steal anymore. Shame on you.",

The special was only applicable in there country Germany time zone i.e. 8 hours the day before. How the hell am I suppose to know that. After a lot of emails and argument, I contacted PayPal. PayPal put a hold on the money and stopped the transaction. Steam put a ban on my PayPal account, on all of my 300 games and would not lift the ban under any circumstance. To date I still can not use PayPal on my steam account. Steam are so one sided, they do not care about you the client at all. I have spent thousands of dollars on these games. Do not use STEAM.

Their behaviour in doing such a thing can be nothing but GREED. Instead of hiring some humans and paying them to help troubleshoot valuable customers like myself, they are trying to squeeze as much profit as they possible can out of their sheer lack of human support system.

No info on 2FA issues or looking into it and no info on banning the account where the money was sent. Obviously, the seller account that received my money is at least complicit in fraud, if not the fraudster themself. I have since removed all payment methods from my Steam account and intend to only use Steam gift cards as an extra layer of security. I would highly suggest at a bare minimum not allowing auto payments from Steam through PayPal or storing bank information on your Steam account.Origin review:I got hacked due to malware. 8 accounts were having multiple access attempts from across the globe (China, Germany, UK, Vietnam, etc). These accounts were Steam, Amazon, Coinbase, Binance, PayPal, Robinhood, Meta, and Gmail. All but Steam blocked access with Two Factor Authentication, Steam's 2FA didn't even register. $200 charged and sent through their Community Market to another user. I started a support ticket and it was closed without response. I then contacted PayPal and they just about immediately issued my charge back. Now Steam has banned me for issuing a charge back and blames me for not stopping the malware. The malware was caught with live protection, but it took about an hour. I lost $200 in about 5 minutes, though it has been returned. With some searching, it seems I am far from the only one to have their Steam Guard (2FA) bypassed and losing items or money.",

Years go by and I want to play my old game but obviously I have a new computer since it's been about 15 years, and so I get the old cd out and now since I can't remember what account I set up from back then the code is useless because it's a one time use code and they offer no kind of work around or customer support to get my game so I paid good money for a chore, a useless product and to borrow a game for awhile.  This kind of business ethics is extremely vexing.  My kind built the gaming industry, all the good elements of it, and now we got to deal with this day in age where slow minds that play crappy app games taught the gaming industry that all they need to do is create a shady and or crappy system to extort money from people.  They don't uphold their end of providing a product, they provide a gamble, you pay and the house always wins. I hope companies like this one day go extinct!",

Judging by most of these reviews people are too inpatient to actually wait for a fix or a glitch to be sorted. I have played here since 2013 technically 2007 but I lost that account and then console gamed until 2013 and won't be going back. I made more friends than I did on the 360 way more interesting things and some reviews even state that the game prices are too high. Well DUH these ain't used games and wait for a seasonal offer which actually happen every season and you will get them cheaper than an actual bloody used game or use an alternate site where you can actually buy used keys G2A and others to be exact. Some people are too braindead to actually notice these things.

            "body": "Alright so I avidly use Steam on a daily basis. The return policy is great, 2 hours of playtime allowed and you have 14 days to return assuming you don't play your newly purchased games. I refunded 2 games I did not like with no problems at all and customer support usually takes 24 hours at least to respond to any problem you have. I have no idea why this site has low reviews on Trustpilot but I bet it has to do with steam customer support .If you do a stupid mistake then that's on you(i.e using 3rd party applications then getting banned from the site or cheating in-game then getting vac banned), don't expect customer service to always have an answer for every little problem, a majority of the issues can be solved at the steam forums and if you have a question use steam forums or if users don't have an answer ask customer support. If your problem persists then it's not solvable sorry, that's reality. For example, I once contacted steam support for the creepy sounds i've been hearing when I left steam open, I thought it was from chrome but when i closed chrome the sound still played. I contacted steam support they had no idea what i was going on about, I'm a grown a$$ man and I found that $hit to be terrifying. Luckily reddit had an answer, it was from sound effects from a game I don't even own which is the creepiest part. But ignoring the creepy sound/ambient noise if you leave steam open on the settings for too long, it's a good platform for PC. But if you want cheaper games got to Fanatical for legit keys or G2A for illegal keys(not really illegal but it's shady that everything is cheap on there,but it works, purchased 10 games from there)",

When corporations/publishers/developers participate in anti-consumer behavior, then one avenue users have to warn others of such anti-consumer behavior is to leave reviews.When consumers leave reviews about anti-consumer behavior, this is seen by the corporations who sell their products on steam as unwanted review fluctuations. Steam labels them \"off-topic\" \"review bombs\".The corporations who sell their products on the steam platform, have pressured steam into developing a special review system that detects unusual fluctuations in review scores due to companies doing scummy things, and hide the fluctuation. It's so hard for these companies to not do anti-consumer things that it's easier to hide the evidence than change their business practices.While there is an opt out, these companies can bank on the fact that the bulk of users will not know this censoring system is in place, or that there is the option to turn it off in the settings. Apathy will allow companies to get away with anti-consumer practices with reduced repercussions. A major issue with this is that the definition of off-topic is not well defined, Valve can not be depended upon to be transparent, or communicative, and the whole system is open to abuse. Furthermore it opens the door to further censorship in future.Valve is selling out to the corporations, and giving them increased ability to abuse steam customers, through taking away those customer's voices.",

In my experience with GOG, Sony, or pretty much any other major gaming company’s support, I've always had courteous customer service members that were understanding of the issues I've had and assisted me in any way they could. I wish I could say the same for steam.Recently steam \"replied\" to the only refund request I’ve made while using the platform, but whoever was in charge never actually listened to the issue I had. I’m not angry that I didn’t get a refund, if there were some indication that they read and understood my problem, I’d be fine. I never held a grudge against Sony for denying a refund request of mine because they personally and politely explained why they couldn’t do it.This is why I have a problem with my recent experience with steam, they simply denied my request a few minutes later with a premade response saying I played a couple hours over their time limit. Absolutely no apparent effort or care from whatever customer service member was on duty at the time (if there was one). This was the only time I’ve had to use the refund feature in nearly a decade of using steam, and I somewhat hope I don't have to use it again after this. Even though Steam has tried to improve their customer service recently, It’s still pretty bad. There’s still zero comparison to Nintendo, Sony, or GOG in that regard.",

            "body": "I am troubled about how many stars i should give so i put the average. However i must note that i am an active player and will continoue using the platform.Pros- Endless game database.- Steam sales resulting in extremely low prices.- Steam keys being sold from 3rd party websites as bundles or single titles so you can get even better value for money.- Steam keys can be gifted to friends directly.- Game reviews from actual players.- Social features incl. friend list & chat, news, groups, marketplace. I had some issues finding friends using common nicknames, but unfortunately steam will not let you use their account name.- Direct player invite for multiplayer/coop games etc. without depending on the actual game's multiplayer interface. For example when playing online games that require certain ports that your firewall or router has closed for any reason, you can result in losing hours trying to connect through the game client, while through steam overlay you can connect directly.- Workshop for finding user or official made content.Cons- Customer support; as you will notice from most reviews it can vary from extremely terrible to very helpful. I think the reason for this is purely a matter of people working in customer support. I noticed that the same issue not handled well or even rejected from one person was resolved from another after i insisted. So my advise is never give up even if you are totally frustrated from the replies you receive.- Not all games are published through steam (e.g. new EA games are only found in their platform).- Many old games are not well ported in steam and various new games have serious bugs, but developer support stops early. I strongly recommend reading the user comments before buying anything at all. You should realise that other users' opinions or issues may not be the case with you and should always check the overall picture instead of isolated good or bad reviews.- Market monopoly is never good for developers or players.",

Maybe I just got lucky but after purchasing sims 3 and majority of the expansion packs on steam the other day (with 75% off which was amazing - paid £60 for base game and I believe 9 expansions!!) I could play it fine from my PC but as anyone with a Mac will know its a nightmare trying it transfer it over. This was nothing to do with steam, more just how kindly difficult Mac is when it comes to steam and origin etc. Anyhoo, point being, I was messaging them from the start asking for advice and help and Im amazed at how fast I received responses and they were very helpful! After a few days I'd given up with my Mac after seeing loads of others online were struggling to get sims 3 working on theirs too so I decided it wasn't worth it and asked for a refund and I received a few emails and prompt replies all being taken care of in a matter of an hour of messaging them. Also, the guys I spoke to were so friendly and genuinely helpful - I think their customer service is great! I'm so used to waiting days/weeks for any company to get back to me nowadays. The guys I spoke to were Mauro and Jonathan :)",

There is no way to stop the refund from happening.  What steam has to gain by this policy eludes me (may be just cost efficient) but i'm pretty sure i will never buy any hardware here again and i would have expected more effort from steam to actually get the goods to the customer.No complaints about the customer service people: they have been politely answering my mails within an acceptable timeframe (usually within a day) and helped me as good as they could within the limitations of their jobs.",

What was the point of spending $ on the boxed game if it's going to cost me $80 more for a download just so I can play it.  Steam requires you to spend $5 on their site before you can post a question.  Just another way to get you to enter a payment method.  I took a chance on this game expecting just an online activation.  What it has become is a load of software downloaded to my system that I didn't want, Steam automatically loads now and had completely changed my desktop environment.  I'm disgusted with software that high jacks you system and installs stuff that is nothing more than advertising.  The entire gaming experience has been ruined over the past 10 years by greedy developers requiring subscriptions and constant updates.   My gaming has been reduced to local games only or stuff I pay for ONCE on Good Old Games.com and can use as I desire.

Until one day Grand Theft Auto didn't work! It was just a disaster! I tried different versions of Proton (a special program that let's you play Windows games on Linux), I tried to change the settings. It was like this for a couple of weeks. I ask for help and told them what was wrong. They said keep up-to-date with Github and they consistently look at bugs with games. I asked them for a refund, they said no. I asked them for earlier versions of Proton and the Rockstar application engine that is also used to run the game. They wouldn't do it. I looked at the options and there is no way you can turn updates off! I had it for months, and now I've had to say goodbye to it! I am extremely lucky to complete the game, but I miss it. You always want to go back to a game like this because it's so cool and realistic. They deleted all my emails I sent them via the Steam program. Completely memory holed the conversation! They are so arrogant! I have to give 2 stars because it was good for a while and it's fairly easy to tinker with Proton when it works and it worked beautiful on Linux. But it's like me buying a house and then someone says \"You can't have it anymore.\" It's absurd like my situation and other Linux users. It doesn't matter what version of Linux you use or what kernel of Linux you are running, there are still problems. I'm screwed! It's terrible to treat people like that! I spent hundreds of dollars buying games and a couple of control pads! I just feel it's just awful! Be careful guys!!!",

            "body": "I've been on Steam for about ten and a half years now and have hardly had a problem. The software has always worked fine for me, it is very easy to install and uninstall games and the store has never given me any issues.At first I was apprehensive due to having less ownership of the game than if I owned a physical copy. But when Civilization 5 required Steam I decided to give it a go.Now I cannot imagine having to go back to DVD copies of games, the hassle of finding the DVD I need when I want to play and manual patching. Although there are a few things I'd change about Steam which I'll get to below, something far worse could have taken Steam's place in terms of DRM. Steam can be launched in offline mode and games played offline. The developers can choose to allow games bought on Steam to be launched without the Steam client being open.As well as partly being DRM, Steam has a lot of features which make my life as a gamer a lot easier. Most games support Steam cloud, backing up save files so you don't lose them if you forget to back up when changing computer. Game files can be backed up to an external hard drive to make restoring them a lot quicker than redownloading them. Compared to most competitors such as Origin, Epic Games and Ubisoft Connect, Steam has the most features and the least annoying DRM.There are a couple of things I would change about Steam. I'd prefer it to be totally DRM free like GOG. Although it is great that indie developers are given a chance, Steam make it a bit too easy to publish and there are lots of very low quality games to sift through. You're forced to always be updated to the latest version of a game. I'd prefer if I could pause updates or easily roll back if an update gives me an issue or is not compatible with my save file.I notice a few reviews here saying that Steam is expensive. It is if you buy most of your games full price from the Store. I recommend getting the majority of your games through Humble Bundle and other bundle sites like Fanatical and Indie Gala as well as in Steam sales. The Christmas and Summer sales are best. Getting the bulk of your games through bundles and in sales actually makes Steam an extremely cost effective way to build a library of games.",

            "body": "GETS 1 STAR AS ZERO ISNT POSSIBLEBE WARNED - STEAM's return/refund policy is basically like buying a movie, getting it home, watching it but it cuts out halfway through, and when you try to take it back for an exchange you're told \"You should have known it was defective. You watched the first half so you don't qualify for any compensation\".Erm - Are you serious? Sadly yes I am.I purchased Final Fantasy VIII remastered, a game that takes a minimum of 30 - 35 hours to complete even just for the trophy list, but most people will take 100+ hours as its massively open world.My purchase repeatedly crashed at the Fisherman's Harbour location after 90 hours play (got to fight off the Lockdown Blues somehow). It kept crashing even after dozens of tries at fixes with various settings (including running as admin), and always at exactly the same place. Eventually I gave up.I contacted steam, requesting a credit (not refund) against another purchase as their game is not playable - AND WAS REFUSED?!?Why? Because I had played the game for more than 2 hours. 2 HOURS DOESNT GET YOU PAST THE FIRST MISSION YOU ID**TS!!!!!!!!So if any game you purchase crashes after 2 hours, its apparently not their fault, its yours for not playing the game at light speed to get to the Exception notice/glitch/Crash that might be dozens of hours into a game.Oh yes - and if it is a Steam third party client as with Final Fantasy creators Square Enix, that too is not Steams fault, even though you downloaded the game from Steam. So basically STEAM takes the money, but any issues are someone else's problem.I don't care about the money (it's £7.99). It's about good customer service, holding your hands up and taking responsibility for a product you sell, and for treating your customers with a modicum of common decency.Concepts totally alien to the soulless robots working at STEAM.My advice is that if a game crashes before the 2 hour cut off, DO NOT PLAY FURTHER. Contact STEAM immediately.And if its after 2 hours? Just give up - they don't care and will only send you an automatic response that says:-\"We are unable to refund this purchase to your Steam Wallet at this time. Your playtime of an included product exceeds 2 hours (our refund policy maximum).\"Says it all really.Rant over, SoapBox away.",

However, there is also a lot of experimental games, demos, or greenlight games that should not even be called games. Steam seems good in practice until you come across one of these games and realize the game is only a demo or just unplayable. Like many reviews here, I wanted a refund. I spent ages trying to learn how to actually get a refund as the app has no direct links to it. Eventually found it on google through a forum link. After I applied for the refund it was ignored, so I tried again and it was further ignored. With no phone number and only a bad UI system I never did get the refund. I later read from a forum on thrid party website that is may be because the game clocked more than 2 hours on it. However this was spend using a third party launcher and the other hour trying to stop all the textures being pink and reading forums. I never actually played the game rather spent ages trying to get it to work. that's £16 down the toilet. I have now moved to epic games that has a much easier accessible refund policy built into the app and I will never use steam again. To be fair the days of steam are pretty much over as no one I know even uses it anymore. Not surprising since this is how they treat their customers.",

However, when I selected the option to 'ask a question,' I was able to get my refund request reviewed by a Steam technician.   They understood the situation and were able to refund the purchase to 'steam wallet' (store credit), which is an outcome I can be happy with.   Downsides: Refund requests automatically declined with >2 hours play time due to policy.   Upsides: There is some wiggle room, especially if you have not abused the refund system.  This seems like a happy medium to me. A company won't be trolled by unreasonable customers, and a customer can get a refund for a defective product.    I'm giving this 4 stars because other support teams for other companies have been far worse (looking at you Square Enix). Steam at least has a way to get help while only having to jump through one hoop rather than many hoops.",

I re-installed it, verified the files, moved folders, everything. First of all the game should have worked effortlessly and not break in the first place like any product, but anyway I have been patient, these things happen sometimes. I tried to get support but they say \"You need to contact the third-party manufacturer for support\", which translated means: \"we don't want to help our customers and just wanna give the problem to someone else even though we took your money\". I did so, no reply. I asked Steam for a refund since they took the money in exchange for a broken product (which is borderline illegal), to which they replied \"because you played it for more than 2 hrs we won't refund it\". So as long as your game lasts that long they don't care if it stops running after or if their platform interferes with its launch and even if it's a small problem they won't help as there is no support from them willingly. So be aware, when you buy a game you're actually buying just 2 hrs of gameplay, everything else after it's at your own risk, and no support will be given under any circumstance. Wow...just wow...I feel bad for whoever works at Steam and has to steal money from regular people on behalf of their corporation. Don't come and cry when people crack games not to deal with this and your company goes under.",

I reply and explain I followed their process and their terms and conditions break uk consumer law (which they do) and got a response saying my support case has been closed.I would not recommend anyone make a purchase through Steam as there is very little recourse if something goes wrong, the customer service is extremely poor and Steam do not care about you.",

I have all of my steam login saved on chrome but it would tell me that the login information is correct. So I change my password just so I can get in. Then it keeps telling me I've tried logging in too many times. So I wait til the lock is over. Then it tells me that the password I just changed it to is incorrect. And ofcourse Steam doesn't have a customer support number to call or an online chat. No the only option is to create a ticket and pray someone actually gets back to you. Now I'm logged out of the app too and it keeps telling me the password that I JUST CHANGED IT TO FIVE SECONDS AGO is incorrect and I can't login. So even if they do get back to me I won't be able to respond or even read it because they've made my account so secure even I can't get into it.

But the ting is there are a lot of scammers on steam that try to steal your account and take your valuable items that you own on your steam account. This can mostly be resolved though if you enable steam guard on your mobile device, private your account to only friends, never add anybody except your friends that you know, and never accept random friend requests because trust me they ARE scammers.",

They can just blacklist anyone they want so players can not find your server.They can blacklist and troll any server that becomes popular that is not theirs. The dev that blacklisted my server has decided to leave it on the list for a month, after changing my server name and begging. That's right, instead of gifting me for all the hardship, i'm punished. After providing the community with so much, this is the thank you I receive. My server was one of the biggest and cleanest environments in NMRIH. I have terminated my servers and am deleting this game from my P.C. I'm also leaving Steam because it allows these kind of things to happen. Good luck to anyone foolish enough to continue with a game whos devs dump on it's greatest assets, the players.Server shutdown scheduled for Oct 26, 2018",

Also, being able to share it with others is great (even though I'm the one sharing and all other have no games xD).What's not so great, is the support.If you ask for a refund, it doesn't matter that the reason is or how long you played it. They look at all their pre-given parameters (like \"how long you already own this game?\" and stuff like that) if only one is on the edge, you will not receive a refund.Doesn't matter if you played the game for literally 10 minutes or 1 hour. Nor does it make a difference if you already bought 300+ games on their platform and never refunded anything.They should be more flexible according to this and offer a refund for a game if you don't even have 1 hour in the game and never refunded anything.For other support-related questions, it's really a gamble. Sometimes they keep throwing links in your face so that they do not have to solve it themselves. Sometimes they actually help you. I guess it depends on who's working atm.One minor additional con is that they do not have GTA 2 in the store anymore. Maybe it's a licensing problem, that's why I didn't take it into consideration upon rating.More advanced version of this review TBA.",

Even if they understand what you mean they will never help you with anything specific, they will just give you links to rules that I have already read.",

            "body": "Ok where do I begin. I have had steam for a long time now and they are the worst of all the game hosting sites I am sick and tired of how their client always needs to update, slows your computer down like crap, and essentially reduces the life span of your computer. OK so that's most game clients. But of all the clients I've had, steam has been the worst next only to origin. I hate steam because I cant buy games on my account for my wife and kids unless they each have their own accounts that means logging into different accounts having their own emails and keeping track of everyone's stuff. They have a family setting that just screwed up my computer worse than before I still cant play my games while the kids play their games because you can't have the client running on more than one computer. It feels like YOU DON\"T OWN ANY GAME YOU BUY FROM STEAM!!!! Not to mention they bring back \"retro\" games and improve them like with so called HD graphics. HA the graphics are worse than the original and cause the game to crash more frequently and not perform even half as good as the original The best example is Age of Mythology one of my all time favorite games. On an average power computer when the game first came out it would run almost perfectly 6v6 now on my many times more pwerful machines I run 3v3 and it still lags and crashes so many more times. I'm so sick of it. Steam has taken the fun out of computer games and ruined the dream I had of family game time because I want to only by one game for my family not 1 game for each member of my family as they get older.",

During the download, I thought,hang on a minute, I'm sure I already have this on Steam, so I opened up Steam help and clicked on Alien Isolation and selected refund....it then showed my 2014 purchase and this new one, it also showed 17 hours gameplay. Four times I requested a refund and four times it was rejected, saying I had already played the game for over 2 hours !!How could I have played a game I literally purchased 30 minutes prior for 17 hours??!! Surely the Steam staff will see that I've already bought it and refund me for the latest purchase error.Nope, not interested.

Possibly the worst aspect of the design is that 2-factor authorization is only through a proprietary app, so you have to add a whole separate app to your phone in order to use app-based 2FA. A whole authorization app on your phone just for Steam. Support from the store is useless. For example, Steam Controller on sale. I want two but can put only 1 in my cart so I write them a quick message to check if this is WAI. I watch for a reply. Day 3: controller is out of stock, so I update my ticket with a request for a rain check. Day 4: they finally reply with the message: controller out of stock; Only able to add 1 to cart at a time; Also this is technical support. Wow, they think I hadn't noticed it was out of stock? I reply with a second request for a rain check, and suggest they add a sales support contact to their website. Day 6: They reply saying the controller has no definite plans for production in the immediate future. They do not offer me any alternate promotions or give-aways as compensation for me missing out due to their very tardy reply, and due to their broken/poorly designed shopping cart which cannot ship two items to the same address at once (or their badly configured item pricing versus shipping, if they were using the shipping to subsidize the price and that's why they didn't want to ship 2 to the same address, which shouldn't cost twice as much). Support tickets, I should add, can be made by choosing from a pre-set list of games and such very specific topics. There are not general topics, and barely any \"other\" type options. No \"other\" option is a beginning topic, sales questions don't relate to \"I need sales (nontechnical) support making a purchase\", and there's no \"something else\" option under \"Purchases\".",

But if I'm honest, I have never had a single problem with Steam since about 2006, when they refused to merge my two accounts -- ultimately their right, I suppose, but their security system back then used to be clunky af and their customer service department used to be a whole separate entity that made it really difficult to get anything resolved.  They are much more normalized now.  And since that one hiccup, I gotta tell ya, I've never had a problem.  They refund crap games every time I ask with no hassle, they deliver gifts immediately, they have a righteous selection of big dev and indie games, and I've never had technical problems with Steam itself (sure some buggy \"forever in Alpha\" games crash, but that's not Steam, that's a Buyer Beware situation with the game devs). Tl;dr, yeah Steam has become the easy target to hate, but I use them exclusively for all my gaming except Riot and Blizzard games and have literally zero complaints.",

It was so frustrating that I wanted a refund because the game wasn't even worth the discounted value. (I'm making a point here it's not about the 10 bugs but the 10mins of playtime that were enough to make me eant to return it). No refund given because I baught the game 3-4 weeks ago and policy says 10 days.If Steam makes a fuzz regarding 10€ being worth more than basic customer service and customer satisfaction in a clear 10minutes gameplay case than, well yes, they are in their right to do so, but than I'll look 4 times before putting more money into their company anymore, and obviously I'm not giving them more than the minimum rating for their platform. People and companies, let me be clear on this: CUSTOMER SUPPORT is there for customer satisfaction and to ensure a healthy business relationship with the customer, it's about loyalty.

I grew up with these really old things called CD drives in the computer, where you put this disk in to play your game and stuff like that.If you want to own your games, look for indie games like StarSector (no I am not paid by them to say that, it's just a fantastic game I play often that is not sold on steam and you actually download and own) Steam has a lot of every kind of wickedness abounding on their store. From endless bloodshed and violence to actual porn of EVERY KIND. I close my eyes scrolling through sometimes, cringing at what a wicked culture we have become. the family friendly tab is basically empty, the horror, porn, FPS M rated games are abundant. When I say of every kind, I mean of every kind.As a Christian there is about 6 christian games, and thats it.

You will need to provide the key or email you have used 20+ years ago, if you dont remember nothing will help, I spent 3 months trying to restore 3 000$+- worth account.  Add here achievements, in-game items, etc.As developer:1  - they do not give a f***about you3 -being a  developer with extensive experience C#, C++, Java, JS, PHP, I have sent multiple CVs to them. Ignored at all, some auto-reply message like \"Sorry, we will not work with you, Good luck!\".I tried to talk with them, 0 response.As an indie or external developer compy like Bethesda etc:1  - they do not give a f*** about you2 - 30% tax for them only + other taxes for transactions, banks etc, you will get in best case 45% of your money. Then you have to pay salaries etc, you will have nothing left, no money to eat. Not recommended for indies devs as the main income platform.There are so many bugs and issues, I can not even count all of them. The thing is, they even do not bother fixing them nor helping other fix them. I am talking about support, as there is no such thing as support, behind the support is neural network with simple automated answers. For example, I explay\\ined the situation about restoring my brother's account, provided full info, tips, logs, email, messages, screenshots and card numbers for many years. Every time I received a message like \"please give us first email or key\". When I said that there is none. All they can do is making CS GO and TF 2 hats, nothing else. I would recommend Battle.net, Epic Store with Unreal Engine.Because steam is crap.There are no humans, only bots.",

Everything is different but it will all eventually come to Steam for the most part which is why I would say in this matter it is a must use. Some will be exclusive to other game launchers but the beauty of it is having multiple game launchers to launch any game you want. In this matter Steam is my main since it's easy to connect with friends, find a game your looking for, VR support, and so on. It might not have the best customer service but it is a pretty good gaming engine. This could differ for many other people but this at the end of the day is a personal opinion for this.",

I've sent in a few help requests and gotten mostly canned answers, but with a little work, the issues were resolved satisfactorily. (Mostly comes from me not being able to use their interface)... I almost never have this sort of issue in any other game or game related software.Once, many, many years ago, I had created an account, forgot about it, and then used their little account finder tool to see if I had an account or not. The account finder tool told me my account name didn't exist (when it actually did), so I assumed I must not have made the account. When I found my account by talking to a friend who had it on their friends list, I tried to contact support. But the staff gave me the run around until I told them to use the finder tool with my username. The \"fix\" is I now have 2 steam accounts, one with just a few games on it. Oh well. I'd like to think they would have come up with better ways to verify user accounts now and let you transfer data, google allows for this. But I doubt it.I have had a few games that I got that don't work anymore (not because of steam), but I blame the game company for that, not steam. I leave a bad review on the game and move on.

I felt like it was my duty to inform people with true information before some people decided to take the vaccine. About an hour after I put the post up, a community moderator deleted my post and I recieved a permanent ban from the Steam Community Hub for what they claim was \"false information\". The information I provided was NOT false, in fact it can be backed up with genuine science. Also Dr. Byram Bridle is NOT some random \"conspiracy theorist\", he is a fully qualified viral immunologist from Canada. So for Steam to claim it was false information, well that's just ridiculous and ignorant and it clearly shows that they (along with the other social media platforms) are following the New World Order agenda.I have contacted Steam Support, however it seems like they are not interested in helping me. All they seem to do is palm me off with excuses and lies to justify the ban and to keep me quiet. I've decided to put my foot down and not accept these blatant lies that they keep churning out, but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere. They still refuse to admit that they are in the wrong (which they are). As the saying goes. People who dare to tell the truth always get the most flak...",

I have circled it (in black, so obviously ignore that bit as I added it) to highlight it and can testify that it is far more pronounced when actually waring the headset.I'm really unhappy with this and want it to work at all hertz as my computer is top of the range and more than capable of doing it.Further to this, there is so much glare on the Les sea I have to squint while looking at bright areas during gameplay.

With the new fiasco that has been the Battlefield 2040 release I've been shown the horror that is Steam customer support.  I bought the game while it was in Early Access, as shown on the Steam Store.  The game was buggy, matchmaking was near impossible, and you couldn't even edit your controls.  The very next day after I attempted to play, DICE \"fixed\" the game by removing promised features.  I brought this to Steam Support's attention and was promptly told it was never in Early Access by the first rep (TrustPilot won't let me link the page showing that it was in Early Access, otherwise I would link it here).  The second rep I spoke to had nothing to add, not even about the first rep lying in his response to my ticket.  This game launch has opened up my eyes, because the only way to get support is through an automated system and if you have to deal with people then you may as well just give up.  The company has turned into another major cash grab company and I'm unsure if I will even continue to purchase games through them.  (Username: Loneshadow01)",

            "body": "Edit: Steam reached out to me an helped me solving this issue today. Because of this I am changing from 1 star to 3. Great when a company actually listen to customers and I am very happy again.I've been a customer with Steam for around 17 years now and I've loved it all these years. The other day however, I received a gift from the company where I work, a prepaid Master Card (50 USD). Since I live in Sweden the only currency available is EUR, but to empty the card I needed to use USD because Steam only offer 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 EUR transfers. 50 USD is around 43 EUR and I did not want to lose any money which happened several times doing the top ups in EUR.Anyway, when I was given the card I was on my work computer and since I work for an American company I am always on a secured VPN. This means that I got the option to change to the US region and use USD, perfect! I did it and transfered my 50 USD... but now I was locked for 3 months to the US region. Sure it suck and it is quite a punishment since I did not even buy an item/game or did any trades etc. Then I realised that I could not even buy a game now, my cards, my PayPal .. nothing was accepted because those are linked to Sweden. So pretty much I cannot buy any games AND then I found out that I will not be able to get my pre ordered Steam Deck since it was ordered in the EU region and I am now stuck in US region.The support basically told me:\"As for your Steam Deck reservation, you will not be able to complete the purchase as your account country does not match your purchase country shipping address and payment method. I understand that's not the answer you are looking for. Unfortunately, there's nothing more we can do in this case.\"This is how Steam treats their loyal customers. The worst part is that I bought the Deck for my kids and they are expecting to get it within a few weeks.This is the worst customer experience I've ever had. 17 years as a customer for nothing..",

Steam support claimed that i need to install external \"certificates\" in to my windows(???).

I was making a purchase of Ark Survival Package when after I put it in the cart and entered my payment information. I received an error message “transaction would not go through” so I tried again and got the same message. On the third attempt with a different payment method I still received the same error but also saw a new error message that they were having technical difficulties try again later. I waited 5-10 minutes and tried again but as I went to my cart the price had doubled.  I immediately open a support ticket to let them know what happen and they admitted to technical difficulties but informed me, I had to pay the new price even though their policy states they will honor the sale price for 72 hours if you have trouble purchasing a game.  The policy states“if your purchase fails, Steam will save your shopping cart (at the sale price) for three days (exactly 72 hours) so you can try to make your purchase again. Any discounts applied to your failed purchase will be saved, even if they are no longer available in the Steam store.So if you're trying to buy a game that's on sale, but you have trouble purchasing, Steam will let you try the purchase again within the next three days.We want you to be able to purchase and enjoy games on Steam. If your purchase fails, the three day period gives you time to sort out the issue with either Steam or your bank.”I quoted their policy and explained that they have the information required to assist me and the final response given was?Hi there,I understand any possible frustration here but we have provided all the available information that we have regarding the matter.With that being the case, I will now be closing this help request. If you do need help with an unrelated issue, please feel free to open a new help request and we will do our best to assist.Steam SupportKurtIs there anything else I can do at this point?",

I decided I'd just make another account and buy the game again, as it was the holidays and I was looking forward to playing. Never touched the account again after the ban was up. Fast forward 3 and a half years, I wanted access again, but I no longer had the authenticator, nor access to the connected phone number. I put through a support ticket with steam, and forgot about it. I imagined I'd get a response within a couple of weeks, and through an exchange could get my account back. No. In only a few hours, I had a reply, where a support member had looked over the info I provided, and given me back access to the account. Absolutely amazed by the proficiency and efficiency of the Steam Support, considering the size of the company. Very impressed with the experience.",

            "body": "Scam!!! My son bought a C-130 plane but the cockpit quality is extremely poor, no apparatus images and the flight controller cannot be moved, just like 2D dummy images. We applied for refund but Steam rejected, they replied that the plane has been used, revised or relocated. I checked their rule of refund. We absolutely fulfull their refund requirement. We didn't play this plane more than 15mins, we asked for refund at the same day after purchasing. We submit refund application three times but Steam ignored us, and just sent an automatic email to reject our refund application. So disappointed, this is a scam!Besides, I noticed that it is uselesd if you contact customer support,  because they redirect you to the game support. Then you ask any questions, they just send you automatic feedback again and again, ignore your request!!!",

I did have to provide as much as possible as proof but I am happy that it worked out in the end!

I told them that I won the key at a raffle and so have no bill for it but provided a photo of the key that was send to me. Then they told me that they will need an original photo of the original key so I contracted the organiser of the raffle. They sadly had already deleted the original email (it was a promo key they were given by the devs for a raffle) so they couldn't provide me with a photo of it either. I then decided to screenshot that conversation and forward it to the steam support and then the joke started. Because the organiser of the raffle used my real name in his reply and the name I used for the second steam account was not my real name (I mean who names their steam account after themself...) the support agent then accused me of account trading because the name of the account was different, he then further claimed that there was no prove that I participated in the raffle (even though I gave him the original email I got after winning the raffle and provided screenshots of the conversation with the raffle organizier) and closed with that the screenshots, that he specificly asked for before, were not considered as prove by him anymore...

            "body": "I received an e-mail saying that I had purchased two Steam Games. I answered the e-mail and then looked at my Steam account where I found two games having been purchased for $55.00. I notified Steam that I did not purchase these games. Steam said they found the hacker and charged him the $55.00 but that they cannot remove the fraudulent charges from my account. They said I must pay $55.00 in order to access my account, download games, etc. I have purchased dozens of games over the years from Steam and Steam has basically blocked me from playing any of these games that I have purchased unless I pay the $55.00 for items ordered by a \"Hacker\". Steam says it cannot remove fraudulent charges from my account. So, I'm to believe a 360 Billion Dollar company cannot remove a $55.00 fraudulent charge from one of their customer's account. Sounds to me like Steam is the \"Hacker\".",

Of course, not actually cheating, this issue was soon reported to the game studio and then has been promptly ignored for over a month. Not just me with this issue, many many others.Unhappy with this outcome of not being able to play something I paid $150 for, I contacted Steam support twice, asking for a refund, as per Australian consumer law, a product with a major defect should be fixed or refunded, to which Steam and B4B game maker denied.Unhappy with this outcome also, I contacted Steam support again, which was unsuccessful. They even decided to create a ticket for me, after seeing how annoyed I was at being scammed, but then after a couple more days they decided there's still nothing they are willing to do and closed the ticket.If you want to be scammed, go ahead and use Steam / buy TRS games. I will be opting out of this and using other game stores instead. I highly recommend any other Australians that have had similar issues contact the ACCC and let them know, as I have done. Hopefully they can hold Valve to account again in the future.",

            "body": "My Son just bought a game from Steam which didn't work on his laptop.  He is 12 years old and just starting to take charge of his own money and find his way.  As parent's that's what you encourage them to do.His experience with Steam sums up corporate (don't care) American business.  As long as you have parted with your money and it's in their account they don't care.Excited 12 year old gets a £50 present from his older Brother and goes online to get the one thing he really wants.  Ark survival for his laptop.  He doesn't check the system requirements properly and after a few hours of trying to get it to work he realizes that it's not going to so he asks for a refund.  Not a chance (2 hour rule that Steam apply is strictly enforced).  Steam are all about money but they are missing the bigger picture which is why they haven't got to and will never be a big player.  Their customer service is worse than Ryan Air.  My 12 year old Son will never buy anything from them again and will never say anything good about them to his mates.  He has been burnt.For anyone wanting to buy something from Steam I would advise this.  Double check the system requirements needed on your machine for the game you want to buy because if you make a mistake Steam really don't give a damn and they wont refund you.  Your money will be in their back pocket and they will give a stock reply (despite their claim of case by case consideration) of 'No refund'. Customer service holds no importance to these guys, shame on you.",

I have referred 5 people to steam. I've spent over $1000.00 on Steam. Had a small issue when purchasing a game bundle when on sale. I bought the game and both expansion packs individually and not in the bundle (saved about 30% in the bundle)I sent steam my first ever email in the whole 10 years.. asking if it was okay to refund me the difference as I did not see the bundle option (my fault) until I purchased the last expansion (I bought 3 items each for myself and also my friend) (who I referred to steam)Staff basically said NO. There names are here: It is unfortunate. As they do not value long serving customers. And the issue was only over a lousy $10 or so... I asked them if they could credit my account the difference. They said no. So I am choosing to move to an alternative game provider. I'm not mentioning names but it is a big competitor to steam.It is a darn shame that they treated me this way.. because I just injured myself at work and and planning on gaming for the next 6 or so months.

I bought the game and spent the day installing it, it was laggy in parts but I was so desperate to play the game I persevered and tried to get over it. As the game progresses more and more challenges are of course put in front of the player and clearly my computer couldn’t handle the map once I got to Hogwarts and the duals. Not even 10% into the game and it’s he immersion is just completely ruined by the lag and loading at doors. Tried to explain this to Steam (games don’t come cheap these days…) and because I am over the 2hr mark they refuse the refund. Whilst I understand this policy from one perspective… I find it unfair that I have been punished for trying to persevere with the game… not to mention in this circumstance you don’t even meet the full force of the game’s map and challenges within 2 hours of gameplay.Another reminder of why it is better to be a console gamer… at least you’re guaranteed the game will work for £50",

A policy doesn't mean anything if it contradicts law. They can have as many policies as they like but if they sell you a faulty product and (in my case at lease) you can prove a faulty product has been sold, then they should refund, replace or repair. Id recommend that ANYONE that has these kinds of issues contacts the relevant ombudsman no matter how small the amount of money lost is, because these companies will continue to behave this way unless challenged.

As I slept and dreamt horrors of never being able to own Cyberpunk2077 due to my own foolishness, the steam support crew worked tirelessly to isolate my problem and resolve my query.I awoke to a well written and polite inquiry from them as to whether or not I had the receipt from my purchase remaining, After a cursory search, tragedy struck! I had misplaced my receipt! After several hours upturning every possible location and sifting through garbage cans, I had no choice but to conclude my quarry was lost.This is the point when most support services would declare yours a helpless case, resigning you to endless transfers and \"we're working on it, we'll get back to you\" emails. But not steam support! oh no! they ramped it up a notch, assigning only the best of the best to my conundrum (Anne).And so just as I was proceeding to analyze the ripped off sticker under a microscope to possibly glean some sort of clue, I got THE message (and just a few hours after I had informed them of the missing receipt to boot), stating that the issue was resolved!With only the scantest of information the steam support crew had managed to track down my missing $100 and reunite me with my once-lost funds, clearly proving their absolute dominance over all competitors.5/5 service 10/10 service 100/100 service there is not a number high enough to express my gratitude!TL:DR  In just over a day they not only managed to identify the problem but also rectify it. I am now reunited with my once lost steam funds and am off to become the proud owner of Cyperbunk2077! 5/5 service!

Client changes in 2019 through 2020 have rendered the library more difficult and frustrating to use than just browsing with Windows Explorer.Download speeds have gotten progressively worse, month by month, since around the beginning of 2019.  At this point, downloading a game requires first spending hours repeatedly trying combinations of server and VPN location just to hit 1Mbps.  Sales are still regular and good, but what use is that if we can't browse the games we've bought to launch and manage them, and can't download them without sacrificing all our free time for each one?  Many people are blaming Valve's flat management structure for this, but who knows whether that's the ultimate underlying cause?  Maybe they've tried some new things that haven't worked.  But whatever it is, they could just restore the client and download servers to the January 2019 version and it would be the best update of the last two years. At this point, I honestly wish I could transfer all my software licenses to a different service.  I'd leave Steam altogether, were it not for thousands of dollars in games held hostage.",

I requested a refund from Steam because I was unable to use the simulator without a laggy flight experience. But instead of being treated in good faith, I was denied a refund for using the simulator for more than a very small 2 hours (which by the way I used trying to throttle the performance settings of the simulator to make it playable, all with no luck). I even wrote them a second time saying they were being inconsistent by not refunding my for X-Plane though they had refunded me for Microsoft Flight Simulator, which I had \"played\" for 18 hours according to Steam. I hadn't--those 18 hours were used just trying to download the files! Why refund me for 18 hours, but not 2? I don't like being taken advantage of. Especially considering it costs them absolutely nothing to refund a game purchase since they're entirely digital and there is no added inventory or logistics cost. Their lack of ethics also strikes a nerve because all I wanted with the simulator was to use something healthy to cope with my weakened mental health/increased anxiety due to COVID, and this is how I'm treated.

The fact I cannot link an account to ubisoft because of a server error that hasn't been fixed in years is insane. I genuinely despise their platform and hope that no one has to deal with their bullsh*t ever again. If I could personally deactivate ubisoft as a whole, I would. I wish I was as rich as elon musk so I could buy the shi**y platform, just to delete it.That's not all. I am currently en route to their headquarters to begin popping every employer's tires in the parking lot. I really haven't been angered like this in years, since I downloaded this shi**y f**king platform created by a bunch of autistic down syndrome idiotic fat f*cks. Ubisoft really does deserve to undergo a total bankruptcy, and I hope the creator loses all their money made from such a shi**y platform, I hope their children become lost in the world because their shi**y parental figures amounted to nothing in life other than creating a platform that deserves to be removed from existence.",

Customer service is appalling one star rating on trust pilot just like their games, why does ANNO 1800 have to be published by ubisoft :(, £100 on steam doesnt make a difference becasue it still uses their broken, buggy, game breaking launcher, never again.

            "body": "I bought the Collectors Edition for Frontiers of Pandora from Game which is Ubisoft's UK supplier. I was absolutely gutted when it arrived yesterday and was partially damaged. As part of the edition there is a coffee table style art book that has 2 pages glued together about halfway in. They are so welded down that there is no way of prising the pages apart without causing further damage. The book is not available for purchase anywhere else so it isnt like I can just buy the book elsewhere and enjoy the rest of it. In terms of collectability value, the damage therefore renders the Collectors Edition that I paid £200 for utterly worthless. As Ubisoft designed and developed the Collectors Edition we got in touch with them, not only explaining the problem but also providing pictures and proof of purchase. Our hope was that they might be able to send us a replacement book as we know that other game companies have done this for their gamers in similar circumstances. Unfortunately, Ubisoft is a company that doesn't give a damn about its gamers. They told us that we need to take it up with Game. This was damaged when it was made guys, have you not heard of quality control?! That was last night and  we are still waiting for an acknowledgment from Game. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. I ordered this 6 months ago and have looked forward to it for 6 months. It was a lot of money and like I might as well have set fire to my £200. I'm very angry and will not be buying anything else from Ubisoft, be it games, collectors editions or any other merchandise. If I don't get a resolution from Game, I'll be reporting both companies to trading standards. I never let a company rip me off more than once.",

This has been going on ALL WEEKEND to the point where I was just done I am mentally exhausted just answering the same questions and providing the same response to literally 10 different people but y'all can't have a call center because that would be just too problematic right lol they shut down basically every possible way to get in touch with them besides Twitter.

I explained it was activated on my old email address, which I no longer had access to, but I provided pictures of the game box, DVD's, and activation code. They insisted that they email my old email address so I could prove who I was, which of course I could not as that was no longer a valid email address.

They couldn’t switch versions so they offered to refund but my credit card was closed so I asked for store credit.It took 3 weeks to organise a simple refund voucher code and they sent me an invalid code. They refuse to answer the question on what happens if the game is sold out by the time they can get their incompetent staff to send me a valid voucher code so I can buy the other version but their support staff can’t do anything really except lie with ‘I’m sure it will be fine’ and make out that they are doing me a favour since I am asking for a cancellation (what? I am literally buying the product from them in a different platform?)1 month later and a day before release there are only 4 units left for Xbox and sold out on PS4/Xbox so it’s not fine. They told me that they can’t guarantee the voucher will be raised before it sells out, and to be patient as there ‘may’ be another collectors edition in stock ‘if circumstances are right’ and if not, I’ll have to buy something else from their store. When I asked them to proceed with the refund and I’ll sort it out with my bank, they said they can’t guarantee a refund and they can’t guarantee I’ll get a replacement but they recommend I keep going with the voucher request. WHAT? I’m pretty such that’s breaking Australian Consumer Law since they are literally out of stock now and can’t supply the game I paid for but I should still wait another few weeks and hope they send me a working voucher code to buy stuff that’s not what I paid for? The support staff literally can’t see how flawed that is and not to mention, illegal?Now I have to take it up with my bank to force a chargeback since they are pretty much just committing theft, and don’t seem to see anything wrong with it. Ubisoft support are a bunch of incompetent handballers run by a company who (by these reviews) don’t seem to care since they’re making heaps of money anyways and just have support staff to run customers around i circles then bury the reviews.Next time always use PayPal to buy from them because atleast you’re protected. They are scammers and their support staff literally can’t see how flawed this is and will make out that you’re in the wrong, even in the face of flouting basic consumer laws.",

Another example is the website, the support is almost always useless, one link leading to another; let's not forget the horrendous wait for a live chat. You've ruined games, you can't develop good games and shut down newer and progressive games you work on. You hire devs that don't do their job.

It's been 6 weeks without word from Ubisoft, my case was closed.

            "body": "Recently I wanted to change the email addresss associated with my Ubisoft account, because that email account was deleted a couple years ago. I've tried this a couple times in the past to no avail, just an FYI. I went to try and change it again, but every \"change email address\" page and link just tries to send an email to my old deleted email.So I try customer service this time and write a ticket, since going around trying to find help on the ubisoft page didn't work. I submitted a ticket asking for help, and a bot responded telling me I had to show a receipt of an Ubisoft game from Steam. I was like, \"Okay? I guess that's one way to confirm it's me.\"So I took a screenshot of my receipt and sent it back to the bot. That was hours ago, and they still haven't responded or tried to help. I wouldn't be so mad about this because it's not a big issue, I remember my login information, but Ubisoft doesn't show a sliver of support or help.",

            "body": "I should have looked at this page before I bothered contacting Ubisoft Support.For any of you who like identifying oxymorons. Ubisoft and Support are the perfect example. I bought (Their?) game  \"Star Trek: Bridge Crew\" for my wife and I. I had just received her Brand New Oculus Quest, and mine was less than two months old. I had already loaded several games on my system without issue. I also loaded a few games on my wife's new system without issue. We loaded \"Star Trek: Bridge Crew\" - because my son had it and thought it would be a fun experience for us to play as a family. I tried to load it, and it stopped loading when it reached an information window telling me that it required an Ubisoft account, and I either had to open an existing one, or create one. I created an account for me, and my wife created an account for herself. This did not allow us to proceed. The program still stopped when it got to the Ubisoft information screen. I started out in a chat with a person who didn't have a solution. He said he would escalate. Over several days it got bounced from:Rasika to ShrutiShruti to ShriramShriram to AnujaAnuja to Nick LNick L to Brian CBrian C to EricaErica to Erica  (She was a real piece of work and threatened to close the case. Maybe I should have let her)Erica to Michael HMichael H to Brad Brad gave me a numbered set of instructions, which i followed precisely. I wrote back to him with details of what i did at each step, and even sent him another picture of where the loading process stopped. By the way - I sent them numerous pictures, and file logs, and a photcopy of the receipt, since I assume that one of them thought I was devious enough to be complaining about something I had pirated. Since ten - so called- support agents could NOT come up with a solution, and several times didn't even know what the issue was, what system I was on, or requested information I had previously provided, I finally gave in and contacted Oculus again, and they told me they would process a refund immediately. I smile now as I read that 85% of the comments are one star. I'm sure if there was a zero star rating that those 85% would give it a zero rating.",

Waited and waited and waited until they responded but the person who replied wasn't the same person who tried helping me the first time and this individual would ask me again for \"Proof of purchase, Receipt ect.\" AGAIN!!!! and than I did just that showed them only for the this person to get replaced with someone else which was BS! And they asked me the same thing which is freaking STUPID!!!! because I sent them all the pictures to prove I bought the game but they continue doing this.The worst customer service I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with, these people running this customer service need to be jailed and or fired.",

Right up to this moment I held this company really highly. I can't believe this is how they treat their customers. I should have come on here and see the rating to understand. I had purchased 2 20% codes admittadly a long time ago using the 100 U points system from Uplay via my PS4 thinking there would be games and add ons I could quickly purchase for my PS4. To my major dissappointment, after purchasing these two codes, I realised the majority of the games on the ubisoft store are for PC only as well as being a lot more expensive compared to other stores and therefore I could not purchase the games I wanted. Since then I have frequently visited the Ubisoft store to try and find games or add ons for the PS4 and today I had finally found two games I wanted to purchase. But now I realise that neither of my codes are any longer valid. I look up why this might be and see this new system in place that tells me codes expire after 3 months. This is news to me!This news has been very disappointing to receieve. Had the ubisoft store had the content I orinially wanted on the PS4, I would have used both codes by now and in quick succession. To be honest I feel very hard done by and wanted to complain. I have now wasted 200 U points for nothing. I should not be able to purchase the 20% store discount from my PS4 if the majority of games on offer in the store are not on the PS4. I asked ubisoft to advise and they sent me to the forums.No reinstating of the codes or no refund on the 200 U points. I mean I want to purchase games from them. now they are getting nothing.

Later it turned into the money making machine for the company, no valuable updates, no interesting additions. They keep making it more and more difficult for players to reach the highest level without using diamonds (real money investment).The worst thing about this company is their customer support. During the year I have played it actively, they had a number of bugs within the game. The customer support team is useless and wasting your time so much instead of helping. They had a couple of decent people there, but I think they moved on. Once I needed to call a head office to resolve a tiny issue! The person was extremely helpful and apologies that it went to such a ridiculous way of sorting it out. But honestly overall experience is horrible.If you ever consider to play actively and pay for their mobile games, please don’t.

I understand they are probably grossly understaffed and being that customer support/technical support are not revenue generating, they're usually seen as nothing more than a bill to company stakeholders and thus are given paltry budgets, are severely overworked and understaffed.With that said, we as customers should not be given this kind of experience when we contact a company for assistance, especially when we are their customer.  These last 60 days of dealing with Ubisoft support has really made me question if I want to purchase any more of their products.  Ubisoft have definitely been on an upswing these last few years so they should have customer and technical support in place to match this.Long story longer; I had an issue where my bank was double charged $49.99 USD or so I thought as when I was making a purchase I got a pop up that said my bank was NOT charged due to an error.  Well evidently it was charged even though I received no receipt or e-mail about this charge. It took Ubisoft support ONE MONTH to come to the conclusion that yes, the charge was indeed correct, I received the items I purchased.  One month!  I did not dispute or argue with them about it.  If they said that I received the items and it was just a glitch in theirs or Xsolla's system then so be it.However, I've been asking for the receipts for this rogue purchase now for almost a month following this.  Ubisoft continue to shut my ticket and I'm having to reopen.  They send me the most canned responses imaginable and close the ticket even after saying MULTIPLE times that I am not disputing the charge any longer and I'm not asking for a refund!  I just want the receipt for this charge which they said is accurate!  If this is indeed an accurate charge, why can Ubisoft not provide me with a receipt for it?  Why is this ongoing for almost 2 months now?  Why did Ubisoft originally tell me when I opened the ticket 2 months ago that someone would be with me (and I quote here) \"very quickly\"  yet my ticket remained absolutely SILENT from Ubisoft for almost one month?  I only got a response when I wrote in that I was about to go to my bank and flag the charge as fraudulent. THAT is when I finally got a response...and it was just the generic \"we're working on your issue\" style reply.One month folks...for a response...after asking then once of twice a week for updates...and only after threatening to go to my bank did they even bother to reply.  That is \"very quickly\" by Ubisoft Support's standards!I highly recommend that you think twice prior to purchasing their products or any of their virtual goods.  And if you have to contact their support...be warned that you're going to get canned responses for at least the first week or two if you get ANY response at all from them.Terrible, terrible, unacceptable customer service.",

I'm ready to pay for it, but because I'm in a region that's not English speaking, they force local language on me. I've been to the site, and tried to buy the English (worldwide edition I suppose) which should be just \"region free\" (or something). But do they allow such schemes to cater to that audience that wants any language of their choosing? NO!Yes, its for the purposes of anti-piracy, but... I'm not a pirate, I'm here and I want to spend my money! LET ME!",

            "body": "Let me start by saying that normally if you are trying to purchase a game you already own, you get a warning that you already own the game, or a warning that this can only be a gift. That makes sense, right? Just like on Steam, you can purchase a game for yourself or gift OR if you own the game already, you are given a warning that you already own this game, and it can therefore only be gift!In 2020 I purchased a game on Ubisoft as a gift for my brother. Keep in mind I already owned the game and had more than 500 hours play time in the game. I didn't know that you can't gift games on Ubisoft...Anyway of course Ubisoft is a scamming company, so they let you purchase as many copies of the same game you own as possible. After purchasing the game, I realised that I couldn't gift the game even though I now owned 2 copies. I contacted Ubisoft and they refused a refund because I already had 500 hours in the game even though I’d only purchased it 2 hours ago...I had to contact PayPal to get my money back.Ubisoft then banned me from buying anything in the store, but never actually told me about the ban. When I had trouble buying anything else in their store, they said it was \"maintenance\" and when I questioned them how it was possible that a friend could buy something but not me, they just said that it was an error and try later. Fast forward 8 months and I was still banned and unable to buy anything in their store!On 1st October 2021 I pre-purchased a game which was released at the end of January 2022. Mid October 2021 I found the same game elsewhere but for £10 cheaper, so I decided to cancel my pre-order and get a refund to buy it elsewhere. But Ubisoft can’t make it as simple as you just click to cancel a pre-order, no no.You have to create a ticket and contact customer services!On 10th of October 2021, I created a ticket to cancel the pre-order and to ask for a refund. But by beginning of January 2022, I’d still had 0 response about cancelling my pre-order. I then had to contact PayPal yet again to get my money back. The game was released at the end of January 2022.Then on 10th of February 2022 I got a response to my ticket saying that I’d already got my refund through PayPal.No mention about being banned or getting banned.Fast forward to End of October 2022.I tried to make a purchase few days ago and purchase failed and i have received email that my account is flagged as fraudulent.Here is what email says:\"A recent transaction associated with your account was flagged by our security system as being potentially fraudulent, and as a result, this transaction has blocked. Please note that you have not been charged for this transaction. We will continue to monitor activity on your account as part of our ongoing efforts to protect accounts from fraud.\" Once again contacting ubisoft...Giving me excuse there is maintenance and when i said my friend was able to make purchase and I got this, they said it happens wait 48 hours and try again...What a scam company this is!!Refuses to refund you, but when you get money back through paypal they ban you for their mistake and then they treat you like sh**talking down to you like you are 5 year old, patronizing and absolutely giving 0 sh**s about you!!The worst company out there!I would rather talk to PC technician in call centre in India than dealing with ubisoft scammers!!",

            "body": "Where do I even get started lmfao... Okay.. Well best thing I can say as a reviewer is.. 'NEVER PURCHASE FROM THE COMPANY' seriously though NEVER!.. I'm a huge Rainbow Six Siege fan/player.. I've spent over a thousand in total on merch and DLC and everything with over 4000 hours on my account and like level 200+!! (since wind bastion so imagine how much I played considering king george is a few thousand higher than me on hours played but he's been playing since day 1, I play more than him per year!)I've always played legit and I am a YouTuber + Streamer so you can clearly (obviously) imagine I would play legit due to being watched 24/7... well I got banned by their Anti-Cheat Battleye permanently for cheating?? I've streamed 9/10 games I've ever done of the game and for the games I haven't recorded.. My r6 stats say I'm some silver trash noob... if I was a cheater would I be in silver with a negative KD?? :')Lmfao... but the point of this anyway is I bought every elite skin in the game, plus merch i.e tshirts and pro team jerseys which were a bomb in itself, plus other DLC i.e event packs and rick and morty bundle or pro league bundles.., essentially £1000+ as my friend did the math, you do it if you don't trust as I CBA.. and I bought every event alpha packs so I wouldn't miss out too.. so altogether, everything was soooooo much spent (up to like mute protocol or reworked outbreak event before ban etc..) and to lose it within a click of a fracking finger.. as if I mean nothing as a loyal trustworthy legit customer... Now I'm not gonna lie I'm a wildcard player.. some games I play trash (like some copper 5 lmfao).. some games I play god like (idk, like a plat with brain cells of a diamond or champ but lacking aim hence plat as the example), I'm one of those unpredictable players who can either impress or disappoint .. but I've seen the chat a few times saying I'm reported for getting a 2k? How pathetic is that? I couldn't care less about the report, do it for all I care.. I'm legit!! (little did I know I'd get banned due to Witcher cheats!) Like in my eyes anything under a 4k is lame but sure.. report me and that for getting a 2k.. but the problem is, I heard battleye scans your full PC if they are \"suspicious\" and perhaps that might be where my ban fit in.. I have no r6 cheats.. but I am trying my best to get into the Witcher 1 with the hype of the show and friends etc... and I couldn't win that fight against the first boss (fire wolf creature thing where town is hypnotised as bad people) so I downloaded witcher god mode client etc... and I only use that mod if I die more than like 10 times to save time as I wanna get to witcher 3 and be able to converse with my friends etc.. but I feel Battleye has scanned my PC and picked this crap up and gone \"CHEAT\" when yet nearly 90% of my games have been streamed live on twitch and the remaining have been hard drive recorded or just been boring matches.. either way..I got banned permanently and you have the last 10-12 matches on replay and I viewed every single one.. not one of them were I cheating so why am I permo banned?? and they want me to buy more elite skins.. hahahahaha NO.So to summarise it all.. I supplied evidence and sent it to battleye.. did they respond?? NO.. Like imagine that... the company that falsely banned me after I spend £1000s on their game decides oh no he's deffo cheating permo ban him and never respond.. like wtaf?? I sent them evidence of my streams and matches and you wanna know what they did??? They IGNORED ME?!? Appeal a waste.. No F's given, all my hard worked money wasted.. no chance I'll see that again or get any chance.. not to mention too I'm poor af so Ubi got more than they deserved off my bank... There's me thinking switching from Xbox to PC would be safe.. little did I know you get banned with the littlest of things... What do you want Ubisoft and Battleye? You want me to stop learning computing & IT level 3 at college, delete every software I have? College teaches me database and mobile app macros bla bla.. UBI BAN ON SIEGE... screw you... I provided evidence and you didn't even respond.. you probs laughed about it in your coffee break like every other poor soul you ban whose innocent to this crap.. Learn to ban! not BAN BAN BAN willy nillyseems like in order to play the game you have to factory reset if every time.. so there's no software overlays that'll ban you.. OH don't forget too... never do computing & IT in college either because the software you're learning will be an insta ban too.. UBI wants fresh PC's and they disregard any fracking video evidence you show them.. you could literally show them every game you've ever done on streams and they'll still blank you and refuse an unban... still wanna play R6 PC? if you do.. best of luck honestly.. I give you a year before some random ban.. where's you're proof? oh it's there! nevermind I CBA LOLOLOL",

But over the years, you grow to love it. It begins to have a lot of sentimental value to you, even though objectively speaking it depreciates over time.Then, one day 10 years later, the dealership breaks into your house and steals it back, because over the years it discarded the records to your purchase agreement and has no way to actually verify that the purchase ever occurred. But, instead of acting with, you know, COMMON SENSE because it's been 10 YEARS, the dealership decides it can't be bothered. So instead of just dropping the issue (like any semi-reasonable adult with half a brain would), it instead goes the kleptomaniac, paranoid route, like a 21st century rendition of penny-pinching Ebenezer Scrooge with an unhealthy penchant for snorting crack.This analogy is logically identical to what Ubisoft is now doing by disabling DLC access to their older games, many of which are LITERALLY 10 YEARS OLD, because it can't move past its dinosaur policy of retaining DRM, despite there being plenty of objective statistical evidence demonstrating that DRM does little to nothing to combat piracy.Screw Ubisoft.",

Now they are mostly uninspired games, with amazing ideas (clearly driven by passionate devs) and corporate execution. I think the fact this company is so massive holds back the few talented people that they have working for them.Most of their games feel identical after about 10 hours of playtime. I don't know how I would approach the problem of making a shooter and wintersports games appear similar, but they slapped their infamous open world format on both and BOOM! They are about 85% identical.Every game that launched in past decade or so launched with critical bugs. Some of them didn't even get fixed to date. For instance: Ubisoft games (or maybe the launcher) are infamous for freezing PC after you the game. At this point it's a 4 year old problem that gets its own FAQ page with a generic \"reinstall everything\" solution. Finally, every game shoves microtransactions into my face.  Shop is in every UI of past few games I've played. I bought an \"Ultimate\" edition of the game and it still tries to milk me for more. Can you keep your ads to yourself and 20-40$ \"micro\"-transactions in your launcher please?As I said, a fine example of \"Industry standard\".",

Ubelievable. No one should have to wait months to play a game they already payed for. The funny thing is that I explained the whole situation within the first screen shots and their support is literally SO BAD at reading that I have now had to send the same images to MULTIPLE support agents in order to get someone who will actually help me, most of them just give their problems to the next support agent without actually resolving anything.. BY FAR THE WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT OF ANY GAME COMPANY, PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN BUYING PRODUCTS WITH THIS COMPANY ESPECIALLY IF YOU PLAN ON REFUNDING THAT PRODUCT GOD FORBID youll probably end up waiting months to get it fixed...

Please forgive me for the confusion. It appears that I would not be able to close the case for now. It seems that the team is still processing one of your refunds. We will get back to you once we have more information. Thank you for your patience.------------------------------------------------------------All good, i got a second answer :My name is Ubi-Devin , as I see the issue has been forwarded to our concern team and it's still under investigation. Once the investigation is completed, we will get back to you.-------------------------------------------------------------Every time they answer they close the support ticket, so after 5 days of the last answer i got back to them asking for any updates .Well the only answer i get now from different people its an automatic answer saying the same thing all the time.This is the answer i get over and over:I hope this email finds you in good health. Please do not worry, I'll do my best in order to help you with this and provide all the necessary information. It is to inform you that it has been been already refunded to you, I would request you to please check your bank statement.-------------------------------------------------------------Whats the point of those automatic answers when they have allready escalated this to the concerned Team ?They dont read anything, they dont even check if the support ticket have been escalated, they dont even ask to the appropiate people about an update of the issue, what its their job for most of the people that answer the support tickets ?Press 1 = Automatic answer: Nothing to do with the issue.Press 2 = Automatic answer: Keep close the support ticket with no answer at all.Press 3 = Automatic answer: We ask that you refrain from responding.Press 4 = Automatic answer: Once the investigation is completed, we will get back to you.The number 4 its the one i like the most, they close the support ticket and than not answer for weeks or months, than when they get back to you, they press 1 , 2 and 3 a few times and than they need to re-escalate again and the case back to the queue again from the beggining.I have been waiting 6 to 8 months, on january 31 they forwarded the issue to the concern team and it's still under investigation, now almost a month and they keep closing the ticket .",

I downloaded a gaming demo off of Steam the other day and boy am I glad that I didn't pay a cent for it because I couldn't even access the damn demo because of the terrible way that everything was set up. Before I can even play the game, I have to make a uplay account, which is fine, except for the fact that every time I tried to make the account, I was given an error message that account creations are unavailable at this time. I decided to wait about a day to see if there were any improvements on this front--there weren't, it was the exact same error message. I then decided to look online to see if anybody had any way to fix this; apparently, in order for me to make the account I had to go to the website istelf. Why even offer a service on the application if it doesn't work at all and you have to go somewhere else to get it done?Whatever, I thought this was the end of my troubles; it wasn't. No of course not, that would be too easy and would require for this company to actually try to make something functional. Because of course, now the issue is that it's having trouble connecting, despite the fact that my internet connection is just fine. I reload and try the same thing only for the same problem to arise, so at this point I just decide to try and play offline. Guess again, apparently I need to log in at least once to be able to play offline and apparently in order for me to able to log in at least once, I need to play online, which I can't do. Wonderful. So once again, I have to rely on the internet to tell me what to do, and none of the suggestions worked. I checked my internet settings, I turned off my ad blocker, I checked proxy settings to make sure nothing was blocking the game's connection, I relaunched the game, I reset my computer, etc. Nothing worked. I saw someone say that they needed to download a vpn in order to be able to fix their issue. That's ridiculous. Why should I need to download a vpn in order to fix a problem that shouldn't be a problem to begin with? This is where I gave up and uninistalled the demo.Steam says that I played the demo for 15 minutes and not a single one of those 15 minutes were spent on the actual game itself.This is an absolute embarrasment on the company and it is astounding how they let problems like these remain.",

I am a massive fan of the Trials games and have bought them all over the years. However after dealing with Ubisoft Connect, I will now go out of my way to avoid buying anything from Ubisoft ever again. Ubisoft connect is complete garbage and it makes playing Ubisoft games orders of magnitude more difficult to deal with. From the app not connecting, or crashing, or wanting to always be online, or asking for the password over and over and over, to signing me out not more than 15 minutes since I last signed in (and ticked \"remember me\"), I've just had enough. Curse you Ubisoft and all of your greedy/incompetent executives making the decisions at the top. Alongside the microtransactions that are basically turning Ubisoft into EA Games, the latest Trials game and Riders Republic are both massive hot messes and clearly hasn't been planned properly or tested from a UI point of view, and that's even if I can play them due to Ubi connect garbage getting in the way. Games don't need a launcher nowadays, and Ubisoft's insistence to integrate everything more and more heavily in the terrible launchers has driven away a customer entirely. Well done Ubisoft, you probably wasted a great deal of money and teams of people to create Connect, and all it's done has ensured that a long time customer has grown to hate your organisation and I will be doing my absolute best to avoid playing anything you make in the future. The fact that I'm so angry with your company that I have to write a review here, simply makes me even more angry.I hope you're happy, because I sure as hell am not, and I'm going to vote with my wallet. By the looks of the other reviews on here, I am not alone in my opinions. Well done, your corpoate leadership are cretins who are out of touch with their customers. Sack them all and replace them with an old mouldy potato hooked up to a random decision generator. It wouldn't make things any worse the way I see it.",

I provided them my mobile number, old email, 15 CD Keys associated to the account and was still told that I had not verified my identity well enough to change the email address.For the most part every time I sent a message it wasn't read properly and then the response didn't even make sense. The most recent response I got was I am glad you have recovered access to your email address when I hadn't even said I had.After 4 months of absolutely no help, no assistance and long delays. I went back to my old ISP and had them reactivate my email address so that I could change it to a different email address.",

If the response was going to be THAT generic, they should use AI to send unhappy customers to generic, unhelpful articles instead of making us wait weeks for generic, unhelpful articles. Their automated system kept trying to close my support ticket or would sent me faulty notifications that they had responded, but then when I checked there were no responses.

Unfortunately, no password reset email ever sent to either of my accounts and I could not log on using Facebook either. The go-to move here would be to contact customer support, but unfortunately they don't have a phone number and the only way I would be able to contact them is through their chat function, which you need to log in to do. So I am stuck with a game I can't play and I can't return it to Target either because it has been too long. And I can't even contact Ubisoft to get this rectified.

At the checkout the discount was used, but in the following invoice, the FULL amount was charged. I opened a case and have since had to initiate a chat with the support, no less than three times to get matters moving. It has taken from the 7th of August until now, just to get the discount matter handled. If I hadn't initiated the contact, I'm pretty sure the case would still be ongoing and I would still be kept in the dark.And I'd grown so tired of their stonewalling and keeping me in the dark, that I wanted a full refund. But no, just by downloading the game, I can't get a refund....Pretty neat policy for Ubisoft's wallet, just keep ignoring customers, until they have downloaded your game, before looking at their cases...

WHY would you want to be compared to EA???I'm going to add this because I love Ubisoft's franchises but I'm done buying horribly done RPG's. Please follow my advice. I promise it'll help.Ubisoft: A 1911 is a 1911! A human is a human. In real life you don't go into a gun store and ask for a Level 36 shotgun, simply to be told \"Sorry, you're only a level 35\".

They didnt even replied to me. I have to escalate my refund on Paypal. The lack of communication and zero refund it's incredible bad, I trully can't recommend ubisoft to anyone.Use alternative stores where they care about costumers, like Steam.PS.

In short, due to the atrocious \"support\" that this company has, I will not purchase any more of their products and I would suggest that you do the same.

I have emailed ubisoft, i was supposed to get a response within 48 hours. after a week now, still no answer. I have searched the internet about my problem, and it seems that most of the buyers didn't get the DLC, and it seems like that ubisoft is taking all of our money, without giving us the DLC, very little official news from ubisoft. And all they have said have ben a lie. About 5 days ago they said that we should check our email, because they should have mailed us again, with the real download link. I have checked all over the internet, i can't find anyone who actualy got that email. Ubisoft takes your money, and don't give a shit. I will never buy anything from Ubisoft ever again.

Which would be the time Paypal stepped in to protect my rights on the previous issue, below. You stay classy, Ubisoft.=================I had a terrible experience with Ubisoft support a couple of years ago, and now I'm having another, so I thought it's time to review.In summary, Ubisoft support can take a ridiculous amount of time (we're talking weeks) to respond, and are currently 0 for 2 on actually resolving a request.Current issue: Yesterday I tried to buy 5 games in their sale, but it kept saying the payment failed. I first tried with PayPal, and it didn't even take me to a PayPal login or anything like that, just went straight to failed. I then tried my credit and debit cards (whoops!). It was only today when I decided to try again that I found a forum thread from a month ago, of people complaining about the same thing, and that they'd been charged! So I checked my accounts, and yep there are the payments, in pending transactions. I've updated my support tickets and am not expecting a timely response (see previous issue), so no doubt will have to call my bank to dispute the payments. Yay.Previous issue: I bought a collector's edition of AC Syndicate (on sale, I'm not that stupid), which included a large figurine, and that arrived broken. Here's the timeline of my support case: 2016-12-02: I opened a support ticket, including asking whether I could open the game and use it, or would need to return the whole package. 2016-12-14: Ubi replied asking for photos, which I supplied within half an hour2016-12-19: Ubi closed the case. I added a message to reopen2016-12-20: Ubi apologised for a \"glitch\" when escalating, and confirmed that I could not open and use the game (thanks guys!)2017-01-20: I messaged to chase, and inform them I'd be opening a PayPal dispute on 2nd Feb.2017-02-10: Ubi told me \"In order to request a replacement for your, I would like to ask you to close the dispute.\" Of course, I refused, because why would I trust them.2017-02-22: Ubi messaged again to tell me to close the dispute. I ignored them and escalated the PayPal dispute to a claim.2017-03-06: PayPal offered me almost half my money back, which seemed fair, given the value of the game vs the collector's tat. Part of me regrets not demanding a full refund, just to punish Ubisoft for being so dreadful and wasting so much of my time.As this is a review of the Ubi Store, and not Ubisoft's predatory business practices, I won't even get into the fact that I only bought a collector's edition because I wanted all the DLC / in-game content.",

They had a delay, so I received the game 3 days later. The delivery company apparently also had a nice employee who unboxed the game so it fitted through the mailbox. I wanted to return it so i thought if i do not accept it it will be returned, which would be faster.This was now not possible, since the package was forcefully delivered through my mailbox, so i notified in the support ticket what happened and they said that was unacceptable and they would send a shipment label if i took pictures of the condition of the package. What a courage! Even though I said what the delivery guy did they wanted proof of the condition of the package. Thankfully the package itself was still in wrapping so it was still acceptable for return.After he verified the condition it took them two to three weeks to send the shipment label. Yes almost a MONTH! Their return policy is that a package can be returned within 14 days of receival, well they will take month to make you even able to return it.Like that was not enough it is now December, 2 months after I wanted to return the game, 1 month after the package has been returned to them and they received it (it had tracking so i know they received it). I do not get any replies on the support ticket. The last I heard was that it was put through to the shop team for a refund. This was on October 23th.Since that day I tried to call them multiple times but i never spoke to one person. It puts you in a selection menu and after that it keeps you in a lobby and says no one is available and to please wait.  I tried to reach out to their twitter support page, but the only answer i get there is they have a huge backlog to work through, but on any followup question they do not reply anymore.To this day I still have to receive a refund. This is really stupid for such a big company. I have nothing against their games, I really like them, but this was the first time i purchased a game through their own online shop instead of a local store near me and it is the last time.",

            "body": "Hello,I really appreciate the games they are releasing. There are definitely a lot of talented people involved in the creation process. But, once a game is released, the nightmare for the customers begins. I think the problems began when they somehow concluded that piracy is affecting their business. So they started coming up with their own ridiculous DRM schemes to protect their games against everyone, even their loyal customers. And then they started releasing multiple versions of the same title, with various bonuses, making sure that nobody can get the entire game content. You bought the standard version of a game and want to upgrade to Deluxe, Well, guess what, you need to also buy the Deluxe version. Don't get me started on Assassin's Creed III that was completely butchered. They improved their approach with newer titles, so there's a glimmer of hope, but they didn't bother to fix the older titles. Some of the titles are poorly integrated with the UPLAY platform (like older Assasssin's Creed titles, Heroes Of Might And Magic VI, Splinter Cell Conviction..), mainly titles with DLCs that are incompatible with UPLAY and need to be activated in-game. To make matters worse, some DLCs come with separate installers, which have a 5 download limit and are also set to expire. In some cases, there's no indication (in-game or anywhere else) of what content is actually available. And on top of that, there are DLCs that don't activate properly or simply don't work at all, as the content is missing in-game.Contacting support is a nightmare, They have a very difficult time understanding the problems and come up with some of the ridiculous solutions. With a few exceptions, I felt like I was talking with aliens.",

Support employees close tickets manually apart from closing them automatically. Don't escalate the cases even when insisting on it.Stay away from this company whenever possible. Other game companies provide better and less buggy products and offer a superior support compared to this. Ubisoft is should really be investigated by consumer protection and juristiction.",

Kept continually telling me i would have to receive the pre order then return it with the prepaid postage labels which will be attached to the invoice.

When i request a returns label through email they asked for a picture to prove the game was still sealed (which it was) so i agreed. For the past 4 days they have ignored my emails.Therefore i have informed trading standards as it violates my consumer rights being able to return the item within 14 days.Ubisoft produce average games so i wont be too disappointed missing out on future releases because no way will i purchase anything with the ubisoft name attached again.I advise everyone not to buy direct from their store.

I never usually preorder games because they're usually out of my budget, i tend to either rent or wait for a massive drop in price. After having one of the most unique fun experiences with South Park: Stick of Truth I immediately pre-ordered the gold edition when it was shown at E3. Now a lot of people who ordered this from the PS store were immediately given access to a PS4 digital copy of Stick of Truth, but I'd have to wait as I ordered from the Ubisoft store. So that was a bit of a downer. A year or so passes and I've been really looking forward to when this game comes out, Then in June I was got a new job in Scotland, not long after getting this news I changed my address on the Ubisoft website. Deleted whatever trace of my old address was. Then - Saturday 12th August I got an email saying it has been dispatched to my old address. I called every DHL company I could get hold of, they were all unable to help as the dutch one doesn't communicate with the UK one etc. At the beginning of this I opened a opened a case on the Ubisoft Support site. I managed to track my delivery which was still clearly going to my old address but on the day it said there was a problem delivering, 'issue with the address' - reading this I thought it could be Ubisoft having eventually contacted DHL. But no.. It went out for delivery the next day and apparently someone signed for it. No doubt they didn't actually ask the name of the person, and just gave whoever one of those crap touch screens where all you do it squiggle a line.I didn't hear anything from them until the 19th August. At which point they just said. 'OK got your message we will escalate it'The next message I received was on the 3rd November. 'The request to change the address was made after deadline so this address was never changed from our side, making the only solution now being trying to retrieve the parcel from the old address.'I put money on it they don't know when I changed my address because I KNOW that I changed my address in plenty of time. They're just rubbing their hands of me and telling me to shove it up my... I'm absolutely gutted by this experience. I cannot believe how they have treated me after having prebacked a project of theirs and putting trust into the product. They've now just swallowed my £70 and told me to F off. What a SMALL gesture it would have been for them to offer a digital version, a code for gods sake, would be absolutely NO skin of their nose.",

I ordered the incorrect product by mistake(I only ordered Siege year 2 pass and not the gold adition which adds the game to the bundle). I created a ticket requesting a refund. I waited 4 days(2 working days) before getting a response back saying they are unable to see any order I place. Now I might be mistaken but don't you log tickets using your own account? If so how can the support staff not see orders I have placed on my account?! After a few messages back and forth I managed to attached the invoice(No guidens was provided on what excactly is needed or how to provide it). Since the invoice was attached I once again waited almost a whole business day for a response. I only got a resposne back after asking for a response in another ticket. In this refund I mentioned I used a promo code and would like to have that refunded. The analyst then tested the code and said I never used it before and I can use it again. I finaly received confirmation that this ticket is being escalated for a refund, withthat in mind I though seeing that I am getting the money back I can go ahead and order the correct package I wanted all along.Now when using the promo code, the code is not valid. I mean this is a endless cycle of madness. Please can I just get a refund and get my promo code active so I can use it without loosing the opertunity of the current E3 sale!",

They ignore reasoning and just couldn't wait for an excuse to wipe out coins earned over a 4 month period.Even when i admitted the mistake (on behalf of my son) it makes no difference. I will be looking legal action or a small court claim. They refuse to give me any details on how to complain or write an official letter. How can that be legal or ethical. Anyone that can help further I'd be happy to hear from them.Thanks EA for ruining the fun i once shared with my son as he now refuses to play the game. He's devastated! I will ensure that we never buy any games from EA again and will advise all friends, family and colleagues to do the same. You have lost a loyal customer and you are a complete disgrace. How on earth are you trading and getting away with malpractice is beyond me!",

Today yet another one answered and asked me to provide all the stuff I'd already provided and more.Days have passed and a series of disinterested 'experts' have had me going round in circles and getting madder by the day.This is looking like it's company policy to give paid up customers the run around when they want what they paid for.

The email and password associated with my EA account currently was set up when I was a kid, I'm 27 now. So I couldn't reset it or access the email that's on my EA account because I cant remember the full email address or password for it. The only way I am able to access me EA account is by logging in with my Xbox credentials where I could see that my information was not up to date like my email addres, password, DoB, etc. A 3 hour process of navigating a non-user friendly website and chatting with 2 associates of EA for a simple email and password reset only to be asked multiple questions, not to be leveled with, not to be given a solution, and the chat being cut off on me before there was any resolution both times when my internet connection is phenomenal, is absurd. Kartig-Singh and UJJWAL I believe there names were and they were a total loss for helping my situation. My EA account will remain in limbo inaccessible to me fully for forever, if I want to link my EA account again, I can't,  and even if I unlink my Xbox to that EA account and create another, I'll lose all my progress....EA is a joke and worried about their pockets more than the people they should be supporting as we support them as a creating platform.

Also, if EA is having a really bad day, they will just fully slow your speeds on a full download to a complete stop about 70% of the way through.

It's incredibly annoying that racists get to continuisly harass non-white people on the Gallery, get reported, but doesn't get banned, and EA decides to ban the person who REPORTED the RACIST for, you know, BEING A DARN RACIST! I also NEVER curse when I was able to use the Gallery, not directly at least, and it's not even obvious it's cursing unless I translate what the filler words for cursing mean. It's so unfair that EA is so... racist! They actually SUPPORT RACISTS BY BANNING THE PEOPLE REPORTING THE RACISTS FOR BEING RACIST! EA, if you don't unban me within the next 48 hours, I promise I'll NEVER play your stupid games EVER again! EVER! I'll take backup of that stupid sims game released 10 years ago on an external hard disk, and then delete the game from my PC because it's wasting space. I promise I'll always give you 1 star on every reviewing platform I can find. You're a multi-million dollar company, yet insist that racist people who call non-white people varioous SLURS deserve to continue to harass PoC, but ban the PoC who report these racists? You've lost your shine.I should probably add that the reason for the ban is Harassment, but as I've said, EA have lost their shine a long time ago, and doesn't bother to provide any specific information about the harassment, the exact date when the supposed harassment took place etc.",

They haven't got a clue and really don't care either. Seems most of the despicable company's games are being set up as pay to win. Buy packs. Buy skins , but this and that .

What’s even worse is the player base has become so toxic in these games due to the ability to spam or use exploits. It’s unfortunate that games like ufc 5 get these great reviews from these major companies stating that it’s a good game, but the only reason must be because they are paid to say it because once you get into review places like this, you see the truth.

Not only did it take an excruciatingly long time for any response to my inquiries regarding the deletion of my account, but Parth's incompetence and lack of urgency only exacerbated the situation.It's bad enough that EA makes it difficult to delete accounts in the first place, but having to deal with an unresponsive and inefficient agent like Parth is beyond frustrating. Every message I sent seemed to disappear into a black hole, only to be met with delayed and inadequate responses.I don't know if Parth was simply overwhelmed or if they just didn't care, but their lackadaisical approach wasted nearly 2 hours of my day and kept me hanging for ages. It's outrageous!Not only this, but the fact that I couldn't even delete my account, despite my repeated attempts and inquiries, is a clear violation of GDPR Article 17. EA is blatantly disregarding users' rights and responsibilities under the law.To add insult to injury, Parth eventually left the conversation, leaving me hanging. I attached the chat transcript to highlight the frustration and inefficiency I experienced firsthand.Parth's ineptitude only serves to highlight EA's overall disregard for their users' time and satisfaction. It's clear that they prioritize profits over providing a satisfactory customer experience. If I could, I would give them 0 stars. Until EA takes meaningful steps to improve their customer support and respect GDPR regulations, I'll be taking my business elsewhere.",

I still had my original card and everything. My account showed my redemption and download for the second car from my pre-order, but no Vorn Stallion.The only option to reach out to EA Help for The Sims 3 was by e-mail, which was already frustrating since my past experiences had been by chat for The Sims 4. (I can only guess that this is because The Sims 3 is older.)I have now had 8 correspondence with EA Help as of writing this review, every one a different person.  The first two wanted to verify the email on my account and the fourth wanted to verify ownership by having me send a code back. Yes, the FOURTH. Meaning that the third was an attempt at helping me without verifying ownership.That said, all five attempts at helping me of the eight correspondence never once gave the impressions that anyone actually listened to what I was saying. Every email focused on things like restarting the app, reinstalling my games, checking my EA purchase history, etc... None of their help at all referred to the issue at hand which is content missing from the actual Sims 3 Store or the fact that, at this point, I cannot simply redeem the code again as not only are the pre-order codes long expired but I also already redeemed the code, a fact I know because the other car from the pre-order is in my Store history and readily available for download.As of this posting, it honestly feels like every response is merely a canned pre-packaged response where the extent of anything personal is the person on the other end adding their name. I'm practically begging them at this point to talk to me like a human and actually read what I'm telling them.

Yup, I paid money for games on Steam, and the EA app is required to run them.  But I keep getting errors.  On a computer that is brand-new and more than fast enough.  It is as if their goal is to make sure that nobody can play any EA game ever again.  Good job pissing off paying customers.  I had a horrible experience with Origin 11 years ago, and swore off EA since then.  I figured out that surely they must have figured out how to make a game launcher work in a decade.  Nope.

            "body": "The WORST possible customer service you will ever experience. This is my story;it started off with me wanting to play Star wars battlefront 2 with my brother, i installed it on my Playstation, ofcourse i saw that it was connected with an old EA account i have no access to, the email has been long closed down since it was associated with a provider, so i contacted them, they give you the most brutal questions in order to get access so you can manually unlink, which in 2023 is just bizarre. But they ask you your IP address (like the one you used when you made that account) and several other bull questions, while they know and see that the account has no phone number or credit card associated to it. i've opened a ticket 3 times and every time they give the same unsympathetic get-out-of-my-way reply that says to try again and try to remember more info to gain access to the account, which again i wasn't trying to i wanted to unlink that account from my Playstation, which again in 2023 shouldn't be this stupid, why i cant unlink it through playstation? only god knows. So now i am stuck with a ton of EA games i can NEVER play on my playstation because someone from EA made the most bull questionaire to get your account unlinked, oh no wait!, regain access to my account -_- , which i don't even want, i merely want to unlink, and in order to do that i need to regain access to the account, which once again is Incredibly dumb in 2023. The customer support was incredibly uninvested and did no effort to help me out. As for why they cant unlink it manually is bull cuz i know plenty of other services where i had an old account linked where they WERE able to unlink. Seriously if you have the option to choose a service over EA, 100000% do this since EA is just a money grabbing, ballbusting-Party pooper. Not to mention had 2 customer support agent's with incredibly difficult to understand english, where you come from doesn't matter, but your english proficiency most definitely does when your an international support agent. Had to explain my problem 3 times before they actually understood which was NOT helping either. the day they announce \"PSN now allows you to unlink from EA with your playstation account!\" is when i get so wasted i wake up in my car.",

Keeping the Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game operating without updates already requires minimal effort, so why does Electronic Arts have to deprive their loyal customers of their money and enjoyment by brutally removing Kim Kardashian: Hollywood from the Apple app store and making the Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game inaccessible from April 8th, 2024? This is ridiculous and extremely intolerable, Electronic Arts. All Kim Kardashian: Hollywood players have lost faith in Electronic Arts and fear spending money on mobile games by Electronic Arts as they are insecure about whether the Electronic Arts mobile games will close down later, resulting in a massive loss of real-world currencies. As an advanced Kim Kardashian: Hollywood player who expended a large amount of real-world currencies on Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, I am very disappointed in the decision reached by Electronic Arts to close down Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Please overturn the decision to close down Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Electronic Arts by either allowing other mobile gaming companies to acquire Kim Kardashian: Hollywood or rebranding Kim Kardashian: Hollywood without Kim Kardashian as the celebrity if Kim Kardashian’s contract with Electronic Arts on the mobile game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood has expired, for example using the mobile game title ‘Hollywood Life’ and removing the game character Kim Kardashian from the storylines after the game character Kim Kardashian rings a phone call announcing her break to focus on other priorities, and allow our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood avatar or doll to be the main character.

They deleted my entire windows features and used their mock version of windows. When I complained to help desk I received auto messages. EA games uses several host files and controllers to access, destroy and implant information on my pc. They are using servers, and fictitious services implanted on windows 10 and 11. When I reset windows or download windows from usb or cd, they delete authentic windows files including search bar annd Microsoft store, and implant theirs upon start up. They are constantly changing permissions and adding app extensions and files during gameplay. They have deleted my ssl certificate so I can’t upload any spyware programs. They have destroyed my bios and deleted factory files. They have altered my spyware program and added their fictitious files so their criminal activity can go undetected. . They have destroyed audio by deleting sound and altering the registry. They have vandalized several of my PC’s through their sata controller. I have alerted authorities about their criminal internet highjacking technique as well. I am so appalled that a company can destroy all of my computers tied to my home network.

They deleted my entire windows features and used their mock version of windows. When I complained to help desk I received auto messages. EA games uses several host files and controllers to access, destroy and implant information on my pc. They are using servers, and fictitious services implanted on windows 10 and 11. When I reset windows or download windows from usb or cd, they delete authentic windows files including search bar annd Microsoft store, and implant theirs upon start up. They are constantly changing permissions and adding app extensions and files during gameplay. They have deleted my ssl certificate so I can’t upload any spyware programs. They have destroyed my bios and deleted factory files. They have altered my spyware program and added their fictitious files so their criminal activity can go undetected. . They have destroyed audio by deleting sound and altering the registry. They have vandalized several of my PC’s through their sata controller. I have alerted authorities about their criminal internet highjacking technique as well. I am so appalled that a company can destroy all of my computers tied to my home network.

And I have been playing this game with my current name for years ever since I started playing this game. Same name for many years on other games. When Steam encouraged the players to make their name to represent testicular cancer awareness, I changed my name to this. It has been this name for over 10 years. I have enjoyed playing Apex, aside from all the hackers. I have had some really good games where I am sure someone has reported me for hacking, and they just suspend for my name and dismiss me. They care more about their money than their loyal players. I paid for the game instead of getting the free version. I do not understand how they can allow people to represent their genders, and not allow their players to represent a certain type of cancer awareness. I am fine with people respresenting their gender, sexuality, or whatever. It is fine. None of this is offensive, but they want to say how my name is offensive when it is not. EA is doing nothing major about the hackers who come in and ruin the fun for other players, but they will pick on someone who has been doing nothing wrong. Shame on you EA.",

Went back this morning and the EA App was saying the game needed to be downloaded, yet I could clearly see it was installed on my PC as it was still taking up the relevant GB and was in my games folder. I tried several things to fix this, like uninstalling the app, clearing casch, resetting my PC etc, nothing worked. I eventually gave in and uninstalled the game from my folder and just re-downloaded the game which took a couple of hours. The game was almost fully re-downloaded and right at the end it said \"something went wrong\"  and there was nothing I could do except restart the app. Yet again it was telling me I needed to re-download the game for the 3rd time. Initially I couldn't do this as I only had 15GB left (so obviously it had downloaded) and again I had to into my programs and uninstall the game from there. (If its in my games folder why cant I play the bloody game!) Its now on its 3rd download, I guess ill just wait more hours and see if it works. To make things worse I was trying to speak with someone on EA help but there is currently an issue where you cant select which console you are using, which is a mandatory field which you are required to complete before you can speak with an advisor. (I've seen several people mentioning this on a different website) so I cant actually speak to anyone to get help. The origin App had issues but moving to this broken App was the dumbest thing these guys have done. If I could I would have giving this 0 stars.",

The most recent one is related to an event. Covet has many goals and events (like the rally) where if you hit the goals, you receive rewards. Covet had a glitch (one they admitted to) that miscalculated goals for the rally, and therefore didn't give me or my team our deserved rewards. They have continually refused to give us our earned rewards despite me messaging Customer Support three times explaining the issues, sending screenshots of undeniable PROOF that we hit the goal for the rally, but they do not read and send a copy/paste while refusing to give the rewards we earned. We should’ve earned 35 pieces plus bonus pieces and they only “compensated” us for 8. This was a glitch on their end that will result in us not receiving a closet item worth over $30,000 because of their refusal to give us what we earned. All I am asking is for the deserved rally pieces  that my team do rightfully earned so that we can get our $30k closet piece we earned. I have put over $200 of real money into this game for them to not compensate us with the rewards we earned. I don't know why this is so hard for them to resolve.

I told them i bought the code as a ea c app code and had nothing to do with steam.  they proply apologised and then told me id wait and get email from a special team.

I was gifted The Sims 4 and City living expansion nearly 6 years ago. To this day, some bugs were not fixed. They are churning out one expansion pack after another and not focusing at all on the quality of the content being released. Judging by a few youtube videos, it's obvious that at this point a gamer might be glad that something works at all. Not to mention that if a player wanted to buy all the DLC, they would pay over $1000. Overall, it seems to me that the whole The Sims franchise went to the toilet after Will Wright left. I don't know what exactly is the reason for the low quality, but something needs to change soon or all their paying customers will soon leave. And for a title like The Sims, that would be a huge loss.",

I feel ripped off and scammed. They do resets on games like fifa where you can't import your cards over unlike previous gens. Because It's a new title because they lost their rights with fifa. More like they did the reset knowing profits would soar and they could once again exploit a player base. Everyone loses their teams, but that's fine. You can just spend again for the same cards you already own last gen. The promo card packs they offer, have low pack weight and bad odds and grinding challenges for free packs becomes demoralising when you finish 25 squad battles only to end up with an 84 rating card as well as some other trash which you can't complete an SBc you want with.  Also their customer support is a joke. No one replies and nothing gets rectified. Worst company ever.",

When I first got this notification I thought something was wrong on my end and I put it in my files wrong. I tried over and over, and over, and it still did not work. I looked on social media, TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, and asked my friends about theirs. The main videos that I could find were the same issues as mine, even YouTubers were having problems and would have to pay for people to get it fixed so they can keep making money on YouTube. So this is clearly a bad app to use and I personally think that if this keeps continuing and progressively gets worse then this will be The Sims 4 downfall.",

            "body": "EA Sports FC 24 - The best and the worst game you can play.The Best - because the Ultimate Team game is addictive and fun to develop your team throughout the year.The Worst - The game has more bugs in it than a 100 year old mattress. In particular the menu system which freezes up or puts weird boxes and shapes over the screen more times than I can remember now.The Worst - Because the game is fixed and is only sometimes a game of skill. Unfortunately, EA cannot help but get involved in games where they should basically just leave it to one persons team and his skills against another persons team and their skills. The deciding factor on who should win the game being who has the best combination of a good team and good skills. BUT, unfortunately, it isn’t this way, because in most games EA have programmed the game to help out one of the players in certain situations. The fixing of these games where no matter what you do you cannot score just ruins the game completely.Overall this was my last year playing it and for the first time ever I have removed it from my games console and my phone only a few months into the game. I’m now going back to playing Call Of Duty and thank god that EA doesn’t produce that game because if they did I could just imagine shooting a bullet and watching it swerve off course in the final metre before it hits the target to give your opponent a chance in the game.Seriously EA, I don’t know why you fix the games and help opponents out, but it makes a complete joke out of the game because if you lose you don’t know if your opponent was helped out in some way and if you win you don’t know if you were just good or maybe you were helped out in some way and it was your opponents turn to lose.The laughable part of Ultimate Team is that the better you make your team, the better EA makes the opponents team, in single player and in online play too. I always thought the idea was to make your team better to make the games easier in online play, or, in single player a better team should mean that you could increase the difficulty setting, but no, instead EA increase the hardness of the team you are playing against making it completely pointless to develop your team.Complete waste of time game that just has you going around in circles for a whole year until it starts all over again.",

Their latest game Jedi Survivor is easily the worst game I have ever played. The game was released broken and the combat is absolutely appaling. It took them a month to \"fix\" it and it is still broken. Its cheesy, basic, even games in 1997 had better combat mechanics. In the old Star Wars game you felt like a jedi while playing, in this one you just feel like a lightsaber wielding idiot. But its not only that! EA App is a joke! Ugly, hard to navigate, impractical, buggy.... I honestly do not know what kind of people work at EA, probably it is better that way at least I can sleep at night. Honestly this company is so bad, someone should sue them for scamming people. And they are so crafty!!! Unlike on Steam you can not review a game for everyone to see. Steam is a much better platform! I would not advise you to buy any game from EA! They would need to do a 180 degrees turn if they ever want to come back as a decent game developing company!!! Complete makeover otherwise the company is heading straight for disaster. I would not invest in EA, neither as a customer or an investor.",

I was double-billed and voiced my concern about this through PayPal as this was the payment platform used.  I also addressed EA about it.  EA never responded so I brought the concern through PayPal as a dispute.  PayPal gave EA a certain amount of time to respond but they never responded at all.  PayPal gave back one of my payments, as requested.However, even though there was still another payment that went through and EA has it (I also have proof of the purchase), they not only ripped the Horse Ranch expansion from my Sims 4 library but have put a ban/suspension on my account without explanation.  I've been spending the past few days trying to resolve the problem but all they do is either ignore me or send me in circles.  Nothing has moved forward at all.Because of the ban/suspension, I can't even play The Sims 4 at all.  The customer service has so far sucked as it seems there is none.  There is zero sign of ethics from a company that I've been loyal to since the original Sims was released.  This is how they thank my long-time patronage.  I'm not impressed with EA at all.Right now, the EA I see is unethical and untrustworthy as they not only robbed me with a double charge for an expansion back but robbed me of everything I paid for as a game.  Between Sims 3 and Sims 4, I've forked out close to $1000 with them and if they're unwilling to restore my account then I should have every dime I spent on them refunded back to me.  I didn't violate any agreements when I voiced my legitimate concern.  I wasn't rude but I was concerned.  I'm the one that's been violated here - more than once - by a company that once upon a time had ethics.I'm adding to this - now EA thinks I don't own The Sims 4 at all, which isn't true.  I bought it in 2014, along with most of the expansion packs, game packs, and stuff packs.  I did figure out PayPal screwed up with the Horse Ranch Expansion pack so that's on them.  However, when EA reps can't get their own facts straight by telling me a game I've owned for 9 years I never paid for, we have an issue.  I'm not getting customer service here.  I'm getting customer disservice.",

Okay, fine. However if you're going to force people to install a new app to play the game, why take out some of the most loved features??? The main one that bothers me is the lack of a gifting feature, I used to gift Sims packs to friends and have Sims packs gifted to me on occasion, however this is not present in the EA app with no sign of it being added any time soon. Also you now need to go online in order to turn on offline mode - and I don't even need to explain why this is embarrassingly poor design on EA's part. EA has always been a money hungry company, and releases subpar games on their subpar app and I will never buy another game from EA in the state that this soulless company is currently in",

The EA app is incredibly buggy and some people have trouble logging in. When I tried to play the Sims 4 without WiFi, because it is a game you can play offline, the EA app insisted that I logged in beforehand to activate offline play...which is impossible to do without WiFi. Additionally, there are certain features missing from the EA app that were on origin; such as the gifting feature. I used this often to buy games for my friends.

I thought Ubisoft was bad, but they're practically saints in comparison.Their support section is nearly impossible to navigate. Rather than keeping log of your support issues and maintaining an ongoing chat with support agents, they go by emails which they don't log in a chain or update on your cases account in a logical way. Each reply could take upwards of a week. You will basically get a different person with each reply basically saying the same things. \"My name is this. I really do wish to help you with your problem. Have you taken a look on Answers HQ? Any more issues please don't hesitate to write back.\" And never resolve your issue and rarely even address your issue directly.The customer service reps blatantly don't know their content as they never link you to the particular HQ answers, and in my case, one customer service rep told that my bug has never been reported before. This, I found out was a lie or absolute incompetence, when I found it eventually found the same issue in the Answers HQ. This had been a bug that's been around since April 2022 (This is now July 2023).To cap it all off, EA also makes it nearly impossible to lodge a complaint. You have to use their same impossible to navigate support system to request a call back to lodge a complaint. Apparently you can't make complaints in writing, you can only call.They also forced everyone onto a new EA launcher, which launched with bugs in recording game achievements. They knew this for a year and did not iron those out before forcing all their customers on to it.",

Do yourself a favor - don't deal with EA you will end up regretting it.In addition you CAN NOT question anything that EA does in there forums as they will instead of reaching out to attempt to sort out the problem ban you outright - this is what FASCISTS do, like they did in Nazi Germany.",

This just started the last few days. For months now, when I open the app, my library is sometimes completely blank - empty. To fix that, you have to close the EA background process. THAT logs you out of the app.So, EA thinks I should leave my computer running constantly with my internet connected, so that I can increase my risk of being hacked, because they felt compelled to make the changes that they recently made to where your log-in information is stored. I am deeply angry at being forced to have an internet connection to play their games (other platforms do not have that requirement) and at being forced to use their sub-standard app to launch the games. Why is it not enough that I bought the game? Why am I forced to use an inferior product that makes my life harder, rather than easier??Also, I cannot play Sims 3 or Sims Medieval; two games that I spent hundreds of dollars on, because I am forced to use their EA app, but these games do not boot properly from that app.Add to that the fact that Sims 4 bugs reappear, if they ever get fixed. 5+ years of bugs that are not ever being fixed. Instead of fixing the bugs, their moderators accuse players of filing fake bug reports.",

I don't have a clue where that product code might be. I bought the game through Steam. So I just click on that button and it doesn't give me any place to insert the code they are asking for anyway. Instead it throws another window telling me I am offline. But NO! I am not offline! And then I am stuck there unable to play my game.3 days messing with this.

Within a day I got a response and after I showed them my evidence, like my receipt, they finally restored the game to my account.  The service guy, EA_Colin, told me that it was under another email, which is BS since I have used the same email for the past 20 years, and in fact the email address was listed on the original receipt.  He also mentioned that he was restoring it as a \"one time courtesy\" like he was doing me a favor by giving me the item that I purchased, thanks buddy.

I have spent a stomach turning amount of money on the Sims 4 and additional content. The new EA app has failed to launch my games. Every time the message indicates an issue on EA's end. I, and many other players have also had issues with games not downloading, not showing up in the games library or not showing downloaded content that has already been PAID for. The EA app was not ready for its launch whatsoever, and now many people are having issues launching and playing games they have spent a fortune on. The negligence of EA to fix the issue, or even acknowledge questions about the issues, tells me that EA's real priorities. An app that was supposed to replace origin, that they're forcing players to switch to, IS NOT FUNCTIONAL. I have never left a 1 star review, but I am fed up. If EA will not fix these issues for their customers, or acknowledge the questions their customers have, I will no longer purchase from EA. And yes, I did the forced app restart today and the app will still not let me download the latest content that I preordered. Please do better EA. I want to be able to use the app, many of us want to be able to use the app. We don't hate the app because it's new, we hate the app because it does not work for the majority of players, whether they're playing the Sims or another game. As paying customers, we should not have issues launching the games we have already purchased from your company.",

I havent logged into my account for a while with stuff that I have bought from them for over 1000 Euros. I tried to log into my account but my login had expired so I contacted customer service. He told me that he could not restore my account and the only way for me to do so would be to update my password. I no longer have access to the e-mail address I used to create the account but they can not do anything.So I spoke with the university of Iceland that are forwarding mail from my old e-mail to my new one so I tried updating my password 5 times last night. Nothing, nada.So I contacted them again, now they are telling me my account has been deleted by me and there is nothing they can do.13 tickets have been opened about this case. 13 people have chatted with me. No body can help me. The people that are working in their customer department are all from India, speak very little english and go obviously by transcript.So in order to open my account I need to open new account and purchase the same stuff again because the i and morons that are working in this company are  that dont know what they are doing.There is no way in hell I will be purchasing again what I already have in an account I did not delete but the system did that was designed by moron!

            "body": "I am starting to think that EA are just scammers really.I bought FC 24, maybe 90$ or so. It is my mistake, considering all the issues I had with their anticheat for Fifa 23, but how stupid was I to think they would've solved the issue for Fifa 24. Not only they haven't, but the problem is even worse.I did manage to play 8 hrs of FC24 while using the troubleshooting I was using for FIFA23 but then it stopped working.So I tried all the solutions I could find on Google and one the website, I spent 10 hours trying to solve the error of EA anticheat (hence more than my time spend playing^^).Having more than enough to try endless procedures I tried to contact EA to get a refund, as they basically sold me a game that is not playable. I managed to start an online chat with them. The agent categorically refused to refund me the game because 'he didn't have the refund button'. I asked him to redirect me to someone who does have that button. Instead of what he gave me another pointless troubleshoot procedure and as I had to restart the PC I had to leave the chat. He conlcuded saying that he was sure that the solution would work. It obviously didn't.And what was my surprise when I tried to contact them again. The option to chat online or send them an email was not available anymore...I tried to post a message (a little bit bitter to be honest) on EA forum to ask for a refund. An EA community manager sent me a link to an EA page basically telling me that I was legally not allowed a refund.I feel like even this is untrue. Because I cannot play their game anymore, even if at first I did manage to launch it ; and the fact that it is unplayable is because of their bad software ; they are just not respecting the very basic standard of selling a game that is playable.My request for a refund is more than reasonable, I spent 90$ for a game that just sleeps on my computer without me being able to play it.Even the hours I spent trying to solve the issue are not normal.I take the time to write this review and I will try to put it on as many websites as possible in the hope that maybe people do not make the same mistake as me, giving their money for a dishonest and unprofessional company not even capable of delivering functional softwares.",

I pre-paid for a game pack for The Sims and when I didn't see that game, I thought I hadn't finished my purchase so I bought it again. After a while, I realized that I'd paid twice and reached out. They asked me which purchase to cancel and I advised that the second purchase should be canceled. They gave me a refund, but didn't activate the other purchase. I reached out for help, and they told me to merge my accounts. I did that. And I still didn't get access to the games. After that the option to chat with an advisor disappeared and suddenly, I can ONLY email them. I've emailed and provided them all of the proof and each time I reply, I get a response from a different advisor asking me to give information again.  I'm giving them one more day and then I'll dispute the charges and see if I can get my money back since they won't honor my simple request to reinstate the game I can prove I paid for.  This has been going on for over a week with back and forth replies and getting nowhere. Case numbers are: 154123960, 154127980, and 154233150.

            "body": "-10. Why isn't it possible to do minus stars? Minus 10 stars for all Sims 4 Origin game software and updates: being forced to do everything only online through Origin, including updates.I will try and add this review to every Sim 4 pack I own in order to try and warn people of this problem because it affects every single pack I have bought – and, unless they actually fix it, sadly wasted my money on.As I sometimes prefer old fashioned things, I’ve always been a bit dubious about having to download and play the Sims 4 game solely via Origin and always having to be online to start the game, I think, as I much prefer to have something tangible such as DVDs etc. Unfortunately the latest Origin update has proved me to be right as their latest update has completely and utterly ruined 95% of my game! I had naively assumed that updates could only be a good thing in order to protect my computer and improve game performance. Well, that was completely wrong. 95% of my characters are covered in weird, random tattoos from head to toe and look like aliens – which might be considered fun, but only if I chose that - which I most definitely have not.I reported the problem as a bug on 8th December 2020 after the update on 7th. I used the chat to ask for advice on 10th December, but all they could say was to wait for the next update, whenever that might be as, apparently, they are working to fix the problem their update created. When I checked my case today, 14th, all it says is “NO FIX AVAILABLE” with nothing to indicate that they are actually bothering to try and fix it or not and I can’t be bothered to waste yet more time trying to find out today.I could not be a more dissatisfied customer than I am right now. The actual game is usually great, although Sims 2 Apartment Life was far superior, in my opinion, to Sims 4 City Living, as was Sims 2 Bon Voyage compared to Sims 4 Island Living in some ways. But unfortunately it doesn’t seem like it will be possible to install my old fashioned Sims 2 discs and completely avoid Origin and their download rubbish, as I would like to do, as it refuses to install so far.Unless they actually fix this problem I am definitely not going to waste any more money on Origin, and after this awful gaming experience probably won’t anyway. Thankfully I’ve always waited for 50% discounts before buying extras, so at least I didn’t waste more money than I already have. Just as well it’s only a game and not anything actually important!I had to uninstall and reinstall everything – all because Origin controls everything and is useless at fixing any problems they cause with their updates. They presumably don’t care less about their customers once they have their money. So I’m not going to bother wasting any more of my money on their products because their so-called ‘customer service’ is so useless and a complete waste of time.",

            "body": "EA disabled my account for no apparent reason during tots. At first they banned me from the transfer market which is my fault for buying coins from third party website. So I accept the banned but ever since then I played and grinded the game for more than 300 hours to get the team I currently have. I done objectives, sbc, packs from rewards and so on to build a very good team without the transfer market since my ban. By the way I got market ban in early February and now my account got permanently ban in early May for reasons I don't know. It can't be trading in the market because of my ban from selling players in the market. EA only has the reason why they ban me. I try to contact EA through support but for some reason there's only 2 option to get in touch with EA support team which is through a call and email there is no live chat option. So I want to make a dispute for my account on my banning but it takes to long for them to respond as it says it may take aleast 30 days for them to respond to my dispute and if you make a case it says it may take aleast 72 hours for them to respond back to you. Now it has been more than 72 hours and no reply from EA term of service team about my dispute. I am still waiting but I don't expect any good news about my account. If you manage to get into live chat the advisor are completely useless they can't help you they only give you advice which is useless and they can create and pass the case to the term of service team. The live chat advisor has no power to determine if they can unban your account so they are useless its only the term of service team who can make the decision. EA has the worst customer support ever if you need help or assistance they can't help you and they don't respond in time. You have to wait more than 72 hours for them to respond but for me they still haven't respond to my case more than 72 hours and in the case report it say they will reply in 72 hours and that's a lie. This is the first time in history my gaming account has been permanently ban for no reason.Fifa 21 is not a bad game in my opinion. The only issue is EA and there crappy customer support and how easy is it to get ban from there games. They need to sort this out its a total disgrace.Go to EA answerhq, reddit or fifa forum and alot of people have the same issue as me about there account being ban and EA support team being useless and not helpful at all.",

Low and behold, I can't.  One of my favorite expansion packs isn't on my account anymore.  Sims 3 University Life.  I know that I played it in the past.  I got the game back in 2015 for Christmas from my parents.  I provided them with both of my parents names.  My dad went and got the order history from Amazon.  I showed them that I have my case, game, and key, but the key has already been used on an account and I have no idea what account that could be.  All my other games are apparently on this account, but this one isn't.  I don't know why.  I gave them all of my emails (from my childhood and adulthood), I gave them my parents emails, I gave them anything I could, I gave them my key, I gave them all the order history.  I don't know what else I could have given them.  It's almost like they don't care about helping.  They just want us to spend money again and buy the game again.  I worked with Anchal, Simran, and Sachin on these issues.  Their English was poor, so I don't even know if they were real people or bots, but they were utterly useless.  When I finally gave up guessing the email, I figured someone must have stolen my key and used it.  I can't imagine how else it would go missing.  I don't know how someone could have used my key.  It's always been in my possession, but I suggested it anyways.  Upon that suggestion, they simply checked my account and could see that it wasn't hacked and then they ended the chat with me without anything else claiming that the issue could not be fixed.  I'm staring at my game, I'm holding my game, I've got my key, and yet I cannot play my game and they won't help me.",

            "body": "I purchased Sims 4 Wedding Stories game pack on February 23, 2022 the day it was released and I am actively seeking a refund at the time of this review. It is a game pack that is supposed to add new gameplay features for $19.99. The Gameplay features were inactive. By inactive I mean, you press the button and nothing happens. Which clearly isn't the intention. I contacted EA and eventually they sent me useless instructions to restart my computer and eventually stated there was no fix. March 5, Sims team released a public message saying they were investigating the issues but had no ETA on a fix just said in the coming weeks. It's been 3 weeks and they are still \"investigating\" I filed another case this time requesting a refund since clearly they don't know how to fix it and the game is virtually unplayable in this state. I purchased the pack for the advertised gameplay functions that do not work.There is some community debate on how broken the pack was before it was released and how much the Sims 4 development knew (there was early access game play by simmers that regularly promote the Sims and guess what? It was broken then and they talked about releasing a patch then BEFORE its February 23 release. So they knew. The fact that you cannot perform the advertised gameplay functions should entitle a customer to a refund. Instead I was passed over to multiple agents all of whom promised to \"assist me with my issue\" and then not assist me with my issue. I was asked for my order number to assist with a refund then never received a follow up email so I logged into my EA account and saw EA marked my case as a duplicate (Even though this is the first time I'm requesting a refund) and I had to follow up with a continuation of that case status because I was very confused as I was told they were looking at my order.Next thing I know I receive an email offering to assist me and that they are sorry they couldn't initiate a refund. No explanation, nothing. They knew it wasn't working and didn't have a fix by their own admission and wouldn't issue a refund because it's not within their policy to offer refunds. What? You sold me an unfinished/broken game. What's more disturbing is that EA continued to market the game promoting the new pack and gameplay features after making the public statement on their webpage that they were investigating why the gameplay features were not working as advertised.There was no disclaimer to new simmers or customers that the pack was pretty much a work in progress. And if you don't follow the Sims online, you'll be in the dark as EA help is not very helpful. They string you along for days, \"looking into your issue\" only to tell you, refunds aren't within their policies.  This is just bad business and even worse customer service. It's unfortunate that they think they can promise you one thing, not provide it and then go on about their way and keep your money while they figure out why it's not working. There is no way this pack should have passed quality assurance when the gameplay features don't work. The trailer was complete clickbait and I feel scammed and cheated. They released it unfinished, ignored community complaints for an entire week before making a statement but were very careful not to claim responsibility for the game not working and treated the whole thing like they were just minor bugs. As of 3/16 there is no ETA on when or if this pack will ever perform as advertised.",

They are easily in the billions now. And after reading across various review sites i am still yet to see one positive review in regards to fifa 20 or any fifa of recent past! Atrocious servers and ive messaged EA help multiple times to no avail which inturn has triggered my meltdowns to the point i get physically ill. It sounds silly but when you put so much  time and effort into something that you should be able to enjoy but cant It really is frustrating. This will be the last fifa i buy, infact it will be the last EA game i buy ever. Getting beat is fine. But when the speed up lag kicks in 3/4 times a game leaving your defensive line in tatter and you concede because your defender has ran off into the stands. It happens when wired with ethernet 20m/s ping 35 down speed might not be the greatest but it perfectly fine on anything else i play.. christ i have my xbox on, my brother had his playsation and my other brother will beon his switch and when we all play fortnite together, or all play a different game online we do not experience problems like i do when playing fifa alone WITH a wired connection. Its clear to see the fifa fans will NEVER get the game they deserve after spending so much time and money on nazi’s like EA.",

How does this work especially when video games are legit something that has had trash talk integrated into it for years especially games with proximity chat. Like it’s not an issue that someone was talking to me because I’m not a big baby like some people after they’re called “dumb” or something. I’m not talking about being out here using the trashiest words possible. Just simple trash talk and that can ban you. On top of that they really spend more time taking out trash talking players then cheaters. You can find a cheater every other  game but don’t worry they’ll be back because EA cares more about someone talking trash then a hacker and there customer service is terrible. Ask them how they review the case regarding my ban and I got back a no we will not disclose what we review but also not give you your account back. How does that make any sense especially after I’ve spend $100s on the game just to lose the account for some stupid stuff because I’d rather type then use my voice at the time? Lololol ban the other people too then cuz that’s rediculous just like EAs game servers which will always be because they don’t have the resources to take care of the games issues apparently and now they’re gonna have even less because they’re constantly losing players which is there own fault.

We thought we could bypass this by purchasing it on my laptop and downloading it onto my daughter's external hard drive and playing it on her laptop via the hard drive... we're not tech savvy and my daughter's laptop wasn't having a bar of this. So, we admitted defeat and within an hour or so of purchasing said game I contactes EA Games, via live web chat, to explain and get the money refunded. Now, in accordance with UK law on distance selling and digital content cooling off periods etc etc I knew I was well within my rights to receive a refund. The purchase was made on Sunday April 19th and by the 28th I'm still awaiting the refund. I contacted the company again, which is no mean feat in itself, only to get a load of flannel, saying there was an issue and it had been referred to a specialist team. I pointed out my legal right to the refund and was told yes, that wasn't the problem it was a technical issue, but not to worry they're sorting it out. I left it at that, taking their advisor at face value. Then a few days later (still zero contact from EA) spotted on my case on their website that it was registering as 'Resolved' but still no sign of the refund on my PayPal account. So, yet again I make contact with them via their web chat. That's when I finally lost patience with them. I asked where my refund was, and said that the length of time I'd waited, with zero contact from them, wasn't acceptable. I was met with it was my fault...my original payment method wasn't working for them to refund to, this migrated to it being PayPal's fault to their advisor finally, squarely, blaming their specialist team. The advisor then terminated the chat before I got the chance to respond. I raised a dispute with PayPal, explained the issue and that EA Games were blaming them. They too contacted EA Games and, from what I gather, also got no response...PayPal have found in my favour and the refund has been granted. It's at this juncture that I decided, out of a morbid curiosity, to look online for any reviews on EA Games, I stumbled across this. I didn't realise it was possible to be shocked and yet not shocked all at the same time...but I managed it! I for one, will never, ever deal with this shoddy company ever again. I made the error of assuming a reasonably big, well known brand wouldn't be so bad..how wrong was I? I usually research companies before I deal with them, I let this one slip past my guard, won't make that mistake again!",

I re-opened and closed origin numerus times yet the EA app still continued to show the same pop-up and preventing me from opening the app itself. I should not have to reinstall and uninstall origin just so that I'm able to play my game properly on the EA app, it should be fully capable of doing it on its own. I was so freaked out from thinking that around 30 dollars had just gone down the drain just because of the incompetence of this app. This is an unreliable app and its honestly disappointing. If you aren't ready to switch games from app to app then don't, and you clearly aren't ready. I hope to see some changes soon, or people will continue to be unhappy with your services and quite frankly, as much as I would like to use this app in confidence, I am exhausted and done dealing with this it.",

Contact back the person gave me 7 links of different instructions on ways to fix it and they said if that doesn’t work contact back and I’ll get refunded. Didn’t work contacted again and the person wanted me to do all that stuff the last 2 people told me AGAIN before they could give a refund. I said fine, but was loosing my patience. After that didn’t work, obviously, the next time I contacted the person gave me new things to try and said if that didn’t work they will start the refund process. I tried still didn’t work, so the final person I just asked for the refund since I didn’t want to try and fix it myself anymore, they told me they don’t give refunds for packs. Not gonna lie I was upset. I spend 2 days trying to fix it cause I was told if I tried and it didn’t work I would get refunded. Now, that I didnt want to try anymore, I can’t get the refund cause it’s again policy to refund packs. Why didn’t the first person say that instead of saying they can refund if it if it can’t be fixed?! Not just the first but all the people before the last person said that, seems like a scam to me. I wasted 2 days trying to fix it, and then told well the last four apparently lied cause they don’t do refunds.

            "body": "This hellish nightmare of a company double charged me for a recent expansion. I spent an entire week going back and forth with customer service to get the charge removed. They just kept asking me for the same information that had already been provided to them in previous emails. On day 7, when both charges had been finalized and deducted from my account for a few days, I called my bank and they could see the double charge so they reversed one. In a matter of minutes. After beating my head against the wall with EA for a week. Of course they banned my account after saying it violated their terms of service apparently but I couldn’t find anywhere that they were allowed to double charge you for games and you had to just deal with it. I even posted on EA answers and Chode or Cole or something told me they had no record of me being double charged. I promptly replied with screenshots from EA and my bank of the double charge with all personal info scrubbed. They promptly deleted the evidence citing “personal info” instead of using that information to actually look into my claim. When I commented at the fallibility of this action I was promptly banned from EA answers. I took screenshots of all these exchanges so there is no denying I never did any of the things they accuse me of to justify any of their psychotic overreactions.",

            "body": "I think I'm one of the lucky one since I had to deal with EA only two times. But those times where utterly awful!1) My first problem with EA came when I've started to play Star Wars: The Old Republic. After trying the game (back in the day, I think it was 4-5 years ago, you could play for free, until level 20, with Subscriber Privilege) I've decided to pay the subscription for two months and continue playing. The first month everything was fine, but at the start of the second I couldn't log in anymore on my account and I couldn't even get in touch with the Assistance (since I couldn't log in even on the website). I've tried the generic \"EA: Contact Us\" and nobody answered me on the chat (I couldn't call them since it would have costed me a lot of Euros, and I've waited for almost three hours for nothing). So, for the subscription price I've played only half the time and lost my account completely in less than 30 days.2) More recently I've find out The Sims 4 and I've really liked it. So, I've decided to buy it on Origins (since there was the 20th anniversary discount) with all the expansions (paying A LOT of money) and: first of all there was no Shopping Cart icon on Origin, and I had to buy every installment INDIVIDUALLY (and there's a lot of them). But the worst part was that when I was buying some expansion stuff, Origin started to reject my payment. I've checked that I had money in the credit card (which i had) and I've also tried my girlfriend credit card (and they rejected her after only TWO transictions).My credit card was blocked by my bank because it resulted to them that I've tried THIRTY times to buy something without success (and I swear I've tried only 6 times as my \"Current History\" on Origin says). Also, we still have no idea why they rejected my girlfriend card as well. I know what you might think: \"If the bank blocked your credit card it's not EA fault\". And, in part, you are correct. But here's the problems:1) Why my bank received thirty attemps to buy something when I've tried only six times? I don't think that my bank wants to block my credit card pretending something that didn't happend. The only possilbe reason that I thought is that Origin might have some kind of \"Try Again the Transiction\" (like some phone company when you need to renew your bill contract. They keep sending you a text messages saying that they couldn't renew the contract because there wasn't enough money on the phone). Anyway, it might be also my bank who messed up.2) This is completely EA mess up though. After these two incidents with the credit cards, I've tried to contact the EA Assistance once again and it was like talking to a brick wall. First of all I've posted my problem on their forum and this guy nicknamed \"Drako\" sayed that I should have call or chat with them. The calling was not an option since I had to pay God knows how since I'm in Italy and it says clearly on the website that calling from the mobile it gonna cost (and sometimes the phone company doesn't even allow you to make that call). So I've decided to go for the chat and, even though it says \"Estimated time 11 minutes\", I've waited for two hours without any response.I've decided to put another post on the forum and, again, this Drako guy sayed that I should call them or chat with them. After explaining that I couldn't get in touch with them, he KEPT SAYING THAT I SHOULD CALL THEM OR START A CHAT! Seriously, it was like talking to a Bot or something. I even tried to explain the credit card problem and he just said \"I tried to buy something on Origin and got no problems... Have you tried to call or start a chat?\" O_OI've also told him that I've waited two hours for the chat to open (in the late morning) and that I've tried again for half an hour in the evening, and he just said \"During busy periods it can take a little longer than normal for a chat to be initiated\"... LITTLE LONGER?!? I really hope that after this I will never had to deal with EA!",

I absolutely love this game (even if the maps are terrible and they took everything that made S3 great and junked it) and now that we've BEEN FORCED ON TO THE EA APP I've had nothing but problems. The app crashes constantly to the point that I consistently have to un/reinstall it. I ran into this issue AGAIN tonight but now, after 8 attempts to get it to install properly to no avail, trying every fix I can think of or find on the web, it's finally downloading INSANELY slow. I've checked and this is not due to my system. This absolutely unexcusable sloth download speed is coming from EA. It's been crawling for over an hour and it's not even 1/8 of the way done. EA has squeezed ENTIRELY too much money from our wallets to keep giving us broken, unplayable, infuriating game play (or no game play as I'm experiencing.) This is BS and I won't be giving EA another dime until we can launch the game we've payed good money for without these stupid apps.",

It seems like every other day its down for a week & it gives me some kind of error code that is a lie. Like when I first decided to try Ea app, it worked....for a day. The next day I tried to play the sims 3 & it got to where it was downloading my save file & about to start & then the download screen got all weird looking & an error code saying my save file or game was corrupted. So I deleted everything & started a fresh game but when I saved & exited off & later that day tried to play it the same thing would happen. I unistalled & reinstalled & play fresh & did the same for the same results. I went back to origin & never had that problem. Thankfully I saved a back up file of the game I was playing & origin had no errors pop up, but ea app did that for a whole week. After that week of playing my games just fine on origin & checking everyday on the Ea app, Ea app finally somehow miraculously fixed it self & I could play. But I choose Origin until Ea app is forcing me to switch back, & now I cant play sims 3 for today because Ea app is down & saying something is wrong with my computer. It was working just fine the other day! NOTHING CHANGED ON MY COMPUTER SINCE YESTERDAY!!!!!!!!!!! LET US PLAY ON ORIGIN WHEN EA APP IS DOWN!!!!",

I have been a fair and honest customer but EA GAMES sent me a notice today claiming they suspended my account due to a chargeback issue with my bank. Two weeks prior I had noticed a duplicate purchase upon the receipt for a double charge of a measly 9.98 for two lousy game add-ons. I contacted my pay pal account to investigate the duplicate charge. Low and behold two weeks later PayPal finally got back to me and said they were waiting for a response from EA GAMES. The next day I got a response from PayPal stating that the claim was in my favor. i found out today they closed the claim in my favor because EA GAMES NEVER RESPONDED!! Little did I know that PayPal had a policy that automatically reimburses payment when the party in question doesn't respond after x amount of days!! I did not ask for my bank to reimburse me for 9.98 . The original claim was opened only to make sure that I was not being double charged. It is not my fault that a charge back happened. It is EA GAMES fault for not answering to the PayPal claim that was created only to make sure I did not get DOUBLE CHARGES! Now I found out there is no number or way to contact ANYONE who can take this lousy bogus suspension off of my account! I am beyond furious, so much so that I sent an email to the owner and CEO of EA GAMES. If EA GAMES wonders why I am so upset it is because I am a real human being and have invested tons of money that is now being suspended from usage without proper evaluation, without a LIVE care team member to TALK LIVE WITH! Pay pal has tried to help by contacting EA GAMES but the service number provided is not in service! All I was told by pay pal was that indeed I'd have to wait probably 14 days from a response from EA GAMES! I can see from the comments here that this company needs to be forced to make changes to their  criminal like customer service  practices and bogus policies. I couldn't find anywhere in the Rules about Charge back policy. Where in the description of rules does it say ANYTHING about chargeback!? Are these people crooked enough to assume I tried to get a freebie? What freebie, the add-ons were taken off so where is the issue EA GAMES??? I didn't okay a chargeback! I looked at section 9, nothing, meanwhile I have spent well over hundreds maybe thousands of dollars over the last few years on expansion packs I now have no access to in the event that I ever need to re-download the packs!",

He already said \"thank you i will tell the team\" \"thanks for the information\" i was so pissed cuz i have not sended even a single screenshot or video about the guy. Eventually i repeated myself and he said \"thanks for contacting, have a nice day and be safe!!!\" \"Bye!!\".Worst support ever",

My problem is, that my Xbox user ID was linked to an old EA account I have not used in over 5 years, so I contact them and try to get them to remove my Xbox account from that old EA account, for which I don't have access to anymore, I don't even remember what e-mail address I used on it, and I don't think I'd even have access to that old e-mail address anyways, I explained all of that to then, I gave them the current EA account I use and told them I could prove it is my Xbox account. They still wanted me to tell them and prove what e-mail address I used and even what Credit Card I used on that old account I have not used in more than 5-8 years. They would not remove my Xbox ID from that old account, I can't access anymore, so now I'm screwed of using the benefit of being able to use EA Play with my Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, because I cannot link my Xbox account to my EA account. I even had an EA Play pass membership on my Origin account with my current EA account, and just cancelled that too. These people don't deserve my money. Bunch of Morons.",

I paid with Paypal.My Paypal account showed TWO charges - one for €24.99 at the moment I clicked on \"Pay\", and another 5 seconds later for €26.65. So after a week of them both being there as a posted charge (not pending), I told Paypal that I was charged twice. They fixed the second charge of €26.65. So at that point everything was good - I paid €24.99 for EA Play, as I agreed to do.But on November 9, EA e-mailed me that they're canceling my account, presumably because they thought I didn't pay. Concurrent to this e-mail, they reversed the PayPal charge of €24.99. I have screenshot proof of everything.Further, I had 2 games I had individually paid for in my EA account, and now can't access them.I opened an EA support ticket on November 10, where they promise a reply within 72 hours. It's been 2.5 weeks, and still no response.They should charge me €24.99 (instead of €24.99 + €26.65), and reinstate my account so I can access both EA Play and my 2 separately purchased games.",

I don't understand why people support such a company.EA is one of the failed companies in the world, but still it dares to continue to exist in the same way...pathetic. Even EA customer service and support is the worst ever. If EA would do everything differently and even get rid of that crappy launcher - I might consider buying games again. However, we gamers don't want millions of different launchers and pay anything for bad games.A company like that has far too many problems and it still produces games without fixing anything. I could never forgive myself if I bought a single game from them. We gamers deserve more from the gaming industry than what EA is currently offering. This company pisses off the players and doesn't care about the consequences even though most of the players are already angry.The players make the company - the company does not make the players.",

This whole situation is bizarre in that they are quite blaze about just taking something that had been purchased legitimately and from different vendor and requiring customers to jump through hoops before refusing to return what has been stolen unless I provided an email from over 8 years ago which is of course unreasonable.",

They are dealing with UK customer as if they are dealing with their locals, they don't understand the cultural difference. When I expressed that I wasn't happy with having no service for my money, they ended the call.They don't want to put anything on writing so I can battle to get my money back.Do not use if you do not want to lose your money.Zak",

GAMING: EA has unlimited resources remember? So why do they have servers all on states that are by the ocean and not in the middle anywhere? Every time I play battlefront 2, sooner or later there will be a crap ton of latency and I will be frozen every 5 seconds! I live in the middle of the United States and every afternoon I get at least 200 ms. Strange that I only get that in the afternoon and not morning because in the morning I can get on average up to 130 ms. I think you should at least think and move your servers to the middle of NA East and the middle of NA West. After all, you do have almost unlimited resources.

I researched this and I am not the only one because everyone has experienced this because EA expects you to pay another $600 to make their game barely enjoyable. I know that the packs on the PC are more expensive then on the PS4 but I would rather pay a couple extra bucks then the whole thing and more costing me up to $1000 dollars. The cc community makes no money and does a better job than EA has even had in the game when they have whole groups of people. They give us a half-ass job and then put a $50 mark on it.

            "body": "I got given sims 3 about 3 years ago, I got origin access last month and now sims 3 is no longer working. Apon this discovery I contacted ea support. Firstly i told them i got the game 3 years ago, but they still asked me to look in my emails FROM 3 YEARS AGO the game key, I couldn't find it so i googled how to find it and they had my account info so they should of looked at the game for it. I eventually found it though. after spending 30 mins doing who knows what they told me to contact the seller who i got it from even though the warranty on it from the seller is gone and I can't remember who it was. I thought that was bad enough but they disabled my game so I now have to go buy the game and all of the expansion packs for it again. THIS is not the first time i've encountered this problem, i had it about 2 years ago with an expansion pack on one of my other games which suddenly disappeared, and they blamed it on the seller when in reality it's actually their fault but they don't want to own up to it.",

Haven’t been satisfied with a sports game since 2015, recently thought maybe I’d try the new nhl2022 when it releases, so I logged into an EA game to see where they are at with a few of their games, lockout city it should be called. Knockout City gives me a net code that apparently no one can fix, started trying to get a hold of a person at EA the 28th of may, June 4th was the first time I had reached a human and I had to make a Twitter account follow ea help and send tweet after tweet to get a person to respond. Then for the next four hours I am verifying purchases, dates, personal info, and stuff no one knows but me to finally after all that time get a outstanding yay! Your the person you claim to be and the owner of the accounts and emails. Yay! Then the lady says now we send you to the Terms of Service people cuz there’s apparently restrictions on your account due to some kind of TOS violation. Ok so how long does that take, 30 days, holy moly, I maintain I’ve never done anything to violate any TOS anywhere. I’m locked out of all EA games. Any purchases I’ve made I cannot play. This company is a scam, or they have 100% no control over after they put something in motion. The reviews all over the place for this company would cripple any other company outside of this industry. Why is it ok to steal from your consumers, produce subpar products, give them the run around through poorly constructed websites and leave your staff dealing with unfixable issues that will most likely leaving them with horrible interactions regularly within their daily jobs. You guys are like drug dealers, you love the pple that sell your product but give no care to the pple consuming it. Company is out right evil.",

I think the CEO and other bosses are responsible for this; their aim is just to take your money with a rubbish game. I regret the time wasted playing it; its a mouse trap, they manipulate people desire to have awesome results, the more time you invest in it the harder it is to let go.Don't let your kids fall in their trap!

Why exactly do you need my card information and my IP, as well...what if I haven't purchased anything? I gave my birthdate, my Xbox tag, and a screenshot displaying my tag and account only to be told that it's not enough and or be rudely disconnected. I'm seething, and if they truly cared about customer satisfaction, they'd help a lot more than they say they do. I've seen nothing but horrible reviews and I thought it couldn't be that bad, and by the devil am I sorry I found out for myself. At this point, this isn't a complaint...this is a burning audit. I can only hope someone decides to actually help get my account back before I highly, highly consider putting EA on blast and sharing the screenshots of the ridiculous conversations between four different agents! EA, you owe me and millions of other people. I'll immediately join the 1% that's willing to do something about it. You have my email, so do what's right for the customer and not your deep pockets.

It really is a disappointing mess, and is a prime example of greed and incompetency we have seen coming from American game manufactures. It is honestly depressing that they don't cut the need for Origin from all their games. At least that would fix the problem, and let us move the games to steam, at least that system works to some sort of level.Case in point, I now have 4 games I paid full release price for which I cant use, plus I bought the NEW Mass effect legendary edition, and it required Origin!

First off, please change the subject to make it a little more... you know... urgent sounding? Apparently, my account was banned in March of 2021.I reached out to EA for help, and they basically responded with \"your account was involved in cheating but we can't say for sure it was actually you, still we won't unban you\" with no explanation, no option to prove that I wasn't even accessing my account, no investigation to see if my account was compromised, etc.For instance, when I logged into the support site, my country was literally set to INDIA. Bruh. I don't know about anyone else, but if I go to India the last thing I'd be doing is playing APEX much less be HACKING.I have been an EA customer for over a decade, and have many (many) hours of gameplay in Battlefield, Sims, Star Wars, etc.While I don't expect anything to be done, this is insane.

Basically, any negative word comes to mind, right?  EA is like any other typical large corporation. They promise you the world, the best experience, they're the best, etc. Once you buy into their product they have your money, now you are useless to them. They outsource their support groups that have no idea what is going on. They are provided scripts in order to respond to your support needs. 9.5 out of 10 times their response has nothing to do with your initial question. Mostly because these outsourced analysts EA hires barely know the English language. I submitted 3 support cases needing help with my account on a game purchased online. All 3 responses had nothing to do with what I needed done. Overall, my case was not resolved as expected. Now I am left in the dark with my issue and cannot enjoy the gaming experience that EA games wants us (the customer) to have. EA's social analyst at corp office (who is most likely American) will see these reviews but won't be much they can do other than 1 thing.  The 1 thing that most companies like EA should do when it comes to help and support and that is the word CARE. EA does not care. They outsource to save money. When you outsource, you get what you pay for and that is zero progress. EA..wake up and read the reviews out there.  Your customers HATE you! Its not time to think..its time to replace some of your high ups in the company. Until then you are nothing else but complete garbage!

When I rang customer support for help I was told I need to give them information relating to the account to prove that the EA account is mine. The funny thing is that I don't have any information for that account as I didn't make it or have zero idea who could of made it, I have never made a EA account to play apex so how could i have a linked account?! I made a new account to prove you only have to accept the T&C and you jump straight into apex no account creation. EA help has been zero help at all and it seems like no one really cares and doesn't want to help you. I've now lost over 2 years worth of progress, money, and fun as I was a day one player that was with Apex from its humble beginnings. I will never buy another EA game because of this.I would understand if this was an account I created and forgot the password too but it isn't, and I'm just left feeling like I've been totally ripped off by EA.

            "body": "I've just tried out the Battlefield series of games, and am thoroughly disappointed.  Never will I or any of my family buy any game that has EA as the writer/seller or affiliated with them.  Each and every one won't connect with the EA server, which means it's impossible to play a campaign.  Your games are not saved and you start from the beginning each and every time, no options.  Even have to go through the full game intro.  Not worth it.And they \"suggest\" several things that you can do to fix their games, but tried them all and absolutely no effect.  Never, ever have I heard of this before, and I've been gaming since 1976.  To release broken software, then become totally non-responsive to customer queries regarding this is unbelieveable.  Not that way with Blizzard, Steam.  Seriously, if the game has EA associated with it, read the reviews first. It will change your mind about buying.  I have purchased three of the Battlefield Games now.  None of them work as you would expect. And the other problem, is that their new EA Desktop App, won't even launch the game properly.  It has several issues:  1.  Can't link your EA account to Origin, so you lose access to several games.  It just goes into a loop asking you to sign in to Origin.  If you go into Steam, add THEIR games, they launch however still won't connect to their servers?  What the heck??? Connects through Steam but not Origin or EA app???  At least get the accounts to link properly??  Honestly, how hard can it be to work like your supposed to instead of asking customers to write new Hosts files, and change IP addresses, or flush all programs out of memory (not that any of that works).  This should all be done by EA...no excuses all the time.  Just get it fixed?",

I didn't think it was a problem until I bought a new xbox and an EA game wanted me to link my xbox to to EA but the problem is it only gives me the option of that old deleted email. Won't even let me type a new email in. So I contacted EA to unlink not even give me access to that old EA account. They said they couldn't do it and had to recover my old EA account by asking me questions. They asked for my IP address, gamertag, date of birth, last four a card connected to the old EA account (that was probably one of my parents cards at the time), my address connected to that EA account and two EA games with date of purchase. I have now been fighting with them for like a week and have given them every address I've ever lived at and every game with date I've ever own but they still won't give me access. I just want to play my games online but I need access to the EA server. Looks like I won't be wasting money on EA products anymore because they refuse to actually help!",

I got the ea pass for a bit to try them out and the best way I can describe their games now is as laughable. I mean I'm not kidding... I brought out some of the old games to test my bias and legitimately there's not much of a difference in quality in graphics. Some actually got worse which I thought would be impossible. Not to mention they’ve absolutely killed the joy out of every career mode. I really wish they actually cared about their games, but unfortunately they don't. They got rid of some of the classics like fight night champions. In my opinion, that was one of the greatest games of all time. If they brought it back and kept the same mechanics just updated graphics it would be a great start. I wish they could turn it around, but I have lost hope.

I used to love the game back in the day and decided to come back to the game, to the official servers. What I found was a decaying game, with no regard for new players. If you go with EJ account you're treated like garbage, worst than that, you're not even treated, as it was like you're inexistent. After a while I subscribed only to be promoted to \"garbage\" as to treatment. It hurts me to say that, but don't spend your money with any company/game that has anything to do with EA, as they don't see us as player, but as numbers.

Now in order for you to fight the false ban you have to submit an appeal to the 3rd party, but guess what? The 3rd party does not exist nor do they answer any appeals anymore. Now back to EA, what do they do? They pretty much shrug their shoulders and tell you tough luck. I've never seen such a terrible business model, to sell a product and not even have full control of it and then tell the customer they can't help you.

I mostly just play FIFA, last FIFA I played was 16, bought 20 when it first came out. Honestly think the games gone backwards since then a perfect example of this is career mode. Career mode is the most trash peice of work you can get for a big company and to think they say they want to be a company for the people. Well career mode is a pure player fan mode and it had progressively gotten worse and is one big mess, the development team should be ashamed honestly. The worst is online gaming tho. Lag alone can make it a bad experience but sometimes the mechanics just goes on the Fritz and ridiculous things happen. Offsides when clearly no offside is a prime example. I've had my keeper run out of the way a few times too. Funny thing is when you have a feel for the game it becomes so clear when the game wants you to lose. The momentum swings are a joke to the point where every 50/50 ball you will lose and your players will literally start ignoring your commands and do nothing or the complete opposite of what you tell it. Not to mention the delay in reactions of the players to your orders. If you get those 2 aspects in one game and you manage to win still you either played Steve wonder or your the greatest player to have ever played no joke. The most frustrating thing for me ingame is the tackling and jockeying. Literally every game I need 2/3 attempts per decent attack to get the ball off my opponent because ridiculous things happen while it feels my opponent can intercept a fast paced ball running the opposite way not even watching. The game is actually unplayable 90% of the time and at this point I'll never play a FIFA game again, infact probably Boycott EA all together.",

I spent 3 hours talking to 3 different people who requested troubleshooting from my part despite me not being responsible for the lack of anti-cheat or core gameplay issues. Not sure what troubleshooting is gonna help me not have the game refuse to reload my weapon, not freeze after bleeding out or not encounter hackers. Didn't even manage to get the refund unfortunately. I guess they very cleverly took long enough to make me not bother",

Customers that use voice chat are not monitored, while customers that use text chat are.The problem with this systematic flaw has major consequences to customers who are reported in-game. The chance of a customer getting a permanent ban for using text chat is incredibly high. I will explain in the paragraph down below.Customer A uses voice chat, customer B only uses text chat. Customer A insults customer B with racial slurs. Customer B defends himself calling customer A toxic over text chat. EA support will only receive evidence of the text chat. Therefore EA only executes an analysis on evidence of customer B, because the evidence of customer A is not there. They will quickly come to the conclusion that customer B is wrong. The word \"toxic\" or \"kid\" is already considered \"hateful speech\" by EA. I became a victim of this systematic flaw, therefore I lost a lot of money and no one can help me. With this review I try to reach other people, so they can avoid being banned and hopefully avoid investing in EA. They do not care about you. They only care about the money.",

The games have so much potential.There is always a biased which is great when it’s you but not when is the opponent.I’ve just gotten used to the fact that if I pick up a ea game it’s up to EA weather I have a good or bad game. Sometimes the games will just do what ever they want and you’re just left sitting there thinking what is the point of pressing buttons if it’s just gonna do what ever it wants.  Also FIFA games and the fact that you can spend so much money on packs is absolutely disgusting. It’s a legalised way for kids to gamble and EA should be ashamed of themselves.I will never play an EA game ever again even if they sort out all of the issues.",

I see the same bugs I did during release 4 years ago. Loading times are ridiculous and it's faster to close the game by pressing alt+F4 rather than waiting the game to close.

I have avoided them for years. About 5 years ago, I unwittlingly purchased a game from them from Origin. Origin is EA, I did not know this, I found out when I had a problem with a game. By then I had bought 4 other games. Obviously, I stopped once I knew they were EA. Now, I am in a disgusting predicament having to deal with brain dead people in support of one of their games. Sadly, what I should do is consider it a loss and move on. My stubborness expects some kind of customer satisfaction, which I should know by now is impossible from them.

I told the employees about EA's flaws but claimed they sre among the greatest companies and tjey don't bother helping \"peasants\", so this company discriminates against \"poor people\". Then this angry EA employee started making death threats. He stated he would \"start a genocide on all dark-skinned immigrants\" and repeatedly shouted \"Trump 2020!\" and \"death to all dirty Communists, Bolsheviks and immigrants\".Can't believe EA hires such individuals.",

Part of the bundle is that you get 2 free rare gold packs every week for 12 weeks. However I’d been busy last week and didn’t open my free packs. So I logged in expecting to see 4 packs but instead only 2 appeared. So I contacted EA support thinking it was some glitch. It wasn’t a glitch, They told me that you have to open it during the week and if not they will be removed from your account without any prior warning. These are items which have been paid for and should not be removed regardless. In the end all I got was a sorry and we can’t help you. Honestly wish I could give 0 stars",

If it cost £10 I wouldn't mind but £50 to £80 is robbery. The game needs fixing!!!If you go to ea answers they just blame you for poor Internet or just blame you somehow.

Online is unplayable for anyone that doesn't want to get angry, DDA (Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment) is 100% a thing that is in FIFA games that handicap you from being able to win a game no matter the skill of you and your opponent, Players become sluggish, Shots constantly rebounding off the post, Players out of position (I could go on for a while) few remark this as \"conspiracy theory\" but over the years it has become more and more evident especially in high divisions. I believe this is a way to encourage players to buy packs as they might believe that they're players \"aren't good enough\".EA have ruined a game I used to love and I'm sure many, MANY other people feel the same way, EA should be ashamed of themselves.",

After opening multiple tickets finally it was like magic and they issued a refund.Why would a company spend the resources to make a customer very annoyed and upset to only finally issue the refund?They will never see any of my business ever again and I will not purchase another game from them in the future unless they get their act together.A multi-billion dollar corporation is going to put up a fight over $80 to lose customers forever. I do not understand this business logic, but I hope it serves them well.I could go on for hours talking about how broken the game is; however, those reviews can be found on Youtube.

I have put so much time in FIFA 20 and it's a shame that unfortunately it's been disappointing. Average golden cards would easily outplay you if you are playing online because of server issues. Even though I live in UK most games are very slow and pass, shoot, tackle would respond at least a second late in online game modes. I tried every setting on my PS4 and I have average 50mbh internet speed, most games still slow.Most shots get blocked especially in squad battles as that's the way the game is programmed by the look of it. Scoring from crosses is very difficult. Goalkeepers easily concedes from close corner. Packages are a joke! In 6 months I spent about £150 for packages and completed many tasks to earn packages. I must have opened 1000 packages and the best player I had was 1 x Son and 1 x Umtiti1 x Chilling and 1 De Bruyne. All others average and inexpensive players. Over nearly 1000 or even maybe note packs. That is a joke! I got kicked out of game many times due to the servers and that counted as loss on my record despite having a healthy internet. I contacted EA many times and they say there is nothing they can do and go some troubleshooting which basically helps with nothing. Oh btw they do not compensate! This company is very greedy and do not care about players like me. I suppose why should they because I see on YouTube a lot of people spend thousands of pounds buying packs like maniacs. You can't really blame EA either. So overall this game does not even deserve a star. They are so 👎 I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

I was under a problem where I had to reset the password but unfortunately I no longer had access to the email address linked to the account (this was my fault, I had been meaning to change it) EA was absolutely diabolical trying to 'help' me sort of this situation. I received bleak advice both on twitter and on the EA customer service online chat. I was informed to fill out an 'EA account recovery form' after countless attempts filling the form and emailing it off, the recovery team would not accept the details I had input into the form, although they were 100% my details. I should know as its my account and had been for the past 6 years. I gave them exact informative details but every response was that my form was not filled in 'correctly' nobody was able to advise me on what information I was inputting incorrectly so it left me in a bit of a stumbling block. I knew my account was still on origin but I had no way of accessing it. Sims 4 was installed on my computer but I had no way of playing it and nobody seemed to care to help me out or give any proper advice. I understand the current situation of the world at the moment is not great and workers will be under a restricted situation as I could not call anyone to help me sort this out but I just wish my situation could be been sorted out somehow because I have now lost my origin account and over £200 worth in games which I have now repurchased back with a new account (thankfully there is currently a 50% discount on sims 4 games at the moment) but still I ended up paying £170 to retrieve all the games I lost. This was utterly disappointing, I honestly believe my account was hacked as I cannot see how else the information I input was 'incorrect' including my password but honestly EA didn't seem to care. My best advice is to make sure your account is completely secure and you still have access to your linked email because you will loose your money and account like I did. I put so much work and effort into my games and now they are locked away on an account I can no longer access because EA refused to help me out.",

That makes sense when u think about it as EA made the game...playstation are just the console u play the game on...I mean I'm pretty sure it would be glitchy on xbox too!So I went back to speak to EA...and they are refusing to accept any responsibility...they're refusing to acknowledge any kind of fault with their products.Well...EA...I suggest u read my review and thousands of others...clearly...you suck egg.",

            "body": "I have no idea what to do so I guess I'm posting here.Last year (2020) around March I purchased a game bundle of Sims 4 (1 EP, 1 GP, 1 SP) to add to my base game. After buying the game my husband was unsure of the charge and flagged it on our card. I noticed when my account got banned and my games disappeared. I checked my bank and when I realized what happened I immediately called my bank to allow the charge and then went on EA help to fix the issue. I included copies of my bank statement showing the initial charge and cancellation, then the most recent, updated charge that went through to prove that EA had indeed received the money for the games.After emailing back and forth with a rep, they unlocked my suspended account and \"closed the case\", but did not put my games back onto my account so I could not play them. I reached back out and was told they could not give me my games back and told me to make sure I didn't purchase them through a third party. When I explained that I bought the games directly through them they ceased all communication with me and \"closed\" the second case.Since then I have tried to open multiple cases, including screen shots that prove they received the money and that it went directly to them, not a third-party. I have been repeatedly ignored, even when asking for a customer service phone number to talk directly to someone to fix the issue. Trying to log-in today I find that my account is again suspended/banned and the website won't even let me \"open a case\" to talk to someone.Anyone know how I can solve this or speak to someone to figure this out? I am so fed up with EA and them stealing my games/money. I will never spend money with EA again!",

I tried getting an answer from EA online chat for a resolution to download the game considering it is compatible when purchased elsewhere, but the online tech was slow and unhelpful.
